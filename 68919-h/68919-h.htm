<h3>
THE PROMOTION OF THE ADMIRAL.
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Smith, who ran a sailors' boarding-house
in that part of San Francisco
known as the Barbary Coast, was absolutely
<i>sui generis</i>.  If any drunken scallawag of
a scholar, who had drifted ashore on his
boarding-house mud-flats, had ventured in
a moment of alcoholic reminiscence to say so
in the classic tongue, Shanghai Smith would
have "laid him out cold" with anything handy,
from a stone-ware match-box to an empty
bottle.  But if that same son of culture had used
his mother tongue, as altered for popular use
in the West, and had murmured: "Jerusalem
but Mr. Smith's the daisy of all!" Smith
would have thrown out his chest and blown
through his teeth a windy oath and guessed
he was just so.
</p>

<p>
"Say it and mean it, that's me," said Smith.
"I'm all right.  But call me hog and I am
hog; don't you forget it!"
</p>

<p>
Apparently all the world called him "hog."  For
that he was no better than one, whether
he walked, or ate, or drank, or slept, was
obvious to any sailor with an open eye.
But he was hard and rough and tough, and
had the bull-headed courage of a mad steer
combined with the wicked cunning of a
monkey.
</p>

<p>
"Don't never play upon me," he said
often.  "For 'get even' is my motter.  There
ain't many walkin' this earth that can say
they bested me, not from the time I left
Bristol in the old dart till now, when I'm
known the wide world over."
</p>

<p>
So far as ships and sailormen were concerned
he certainly spoke the truth.  He was talked
of with curses in the Pacific from the Prybiloffs
to the Horn, from San Francisco to Zanzibar.
It was long odds at any given time in any
longitude that some seaman was engaged in
blaspheming Shanghai Smith for sending him
on board drunk and without a chest, and
with nothing better to propitiate his new
shipmates with than a bottle of vinegar and
water that looked like rum till it was tasted.
Every breeze that blew, trade wind or monsoon,
had heard of his iniquities.  He got the best
of every one.
</p>

<p>
"All but one," said Smith in a moment
of weakness, when a dozen men, who owed
so much money that they crawled to him
as a Chinaman does to a joss, were hanging
upon his lips&mdash;"all but one."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we don't take that in," said one of
the most indebted; "we can 'ardly believe
that, Mr. Smith."
</p>

<p>
Sometimes this unsubtle flattery would have
ended in the flatterer being thrown out.  But
Smith was now gently reminiscent.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I was done brown and never got
the best of one swine," said the boarding-house
keeper.  "I don't ask you to believe it,
for I own it don't sound likely, me being
what I am.  But there was one swab as give
me a hidin', and he give it me good, so
he did."
</p>

<p>
He looked them over malignantly.
</p>

<p>
"I kin lick any of you here with one
hand," he swore, "but the man as bested me
could have taken on three of you with both
hands.  And I own I was took aback
considerable when I run against him on the
pier at Sandridge when I was in Australia
fifteen years ago.  He was a naval officer,
captain of the <i>Warrior</i>, and dressed up to
kill, though he had a face like a figure-head
cut out of mahog'ny with a broad-axe.  And
I was feelin' good and in need of a scrap.
So when he bumped agin me, I shoved him
over&mdash;prompt, I shoved him.  Down he
went, and the girls that know'd me laughed.
And two policemen came along quick.  I
didn't care much, but this naval josser picks
himself up and goes to 'em.  Would you believe
it, but when he'd spoke a bit I seed him donate
them about a dollar each and they walked
off round a heap of dunnage on the wharf,
and the captain buttoned up his coat and came
for me.  I never seen the likes of it.  He
comes up dancin' and smilin', and he kind
of give me half a bow, polite as you like,
and inside of ten seconds I knew I'd struck
a cyclone, right in the spot where they breed.
I fought good&mdash;(you know me)&mdash;and I got
in half a dozen on his face.  But I never
fazed him none, and he wouldn't bruise mor'n
hittin' a boiler.  And every time he got back
on me I felt as if I'd been kicked.  He scarred
me something cruel.  I could see it by the
blood on his hands.  Twarn't his, by a long
sight, for his fists was made of teak, I should
say.  And in the end, when I seemed to see
a ship's company of naval officers around me,
one of them hit me under the ear and lifted
me up.  And another hit me whilst I was
in the air, and a third landed me as I fell.
And that was the end of it, so far's I remember.
When I came to, which was next day in a
kind of sailors' hospital, I reached up for a
card over my head, and I read 'concussion
of the brain' on it.  What's more, I believed
it.  If the card had let on that I'd been run
over by a traction engine and picked up dead,
I'd have believed it.  And when I reely
came to my senses, a med'cal student says
as Captain Richard Dunn, of the <i>Warrior</i>,
had bin to inquire when the funeral was,
so's he could send a wreath.  They said he
was the topside fighter in the hull British
Navy.  And I'm here to say he was."
</p>

<p>
He breathed fierce defiance and invited any
man alive to tell him he was lying.
</p>

<p>
"And you never got even?" asked the
bar-tender, seeing that no one took up the
challenge.
</p>

<p>
"Never set eyes on him from that day to
this," said his boss regretfully.
</p>

<p>
"And if you did?"
</p>

<p>
Smith paused, took a drink.
</p>

<p>
"So help me, I'd Shanghai him if he was
King of England!"
</p>

<p>
And one of the crowd, who had put down
the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> in order to hear
this yarn, picked it up again.
</p>

<p>
"S'elp me," he said, in a breathless excitement,
"'ere's a bally cohincidence.  'Ere's a
telegram from 'Squimault, saying as how the
flagship <i>Triumphant</i>, Hadmiral Sir Richard
Dunn, K.C.B., is comin' down to San Francisco!"
</p>

<p>
"Holy Moses, let's look!" said Shanghai Smith.
</p>

<p>
He read, and a heavenly smile overspread
his hard countenance.  He almost looked
good, such joy was his.
</p>

<p>
"Tom," he said to the bar-tender, "set up
the drinks for the crowd.  This is my man,
for sure.  And him an admiral, too!  Holy
sailor, ain't this luck?"
</p>

<p>
He went out into the street and walked to
and fro rubbing his hands, while the men inside
took their drink, and looked through the
uncleaned windows at the boss.
</p>

<p>
"Holy Mackinaw," said Billy, who had
drifted West from Michigan, "I reckon never
to hev seen Mr. Smith so pleased since he
shipped a crowd in the <i>Harvester</i>, and got
'em away that night and shipped 'em in the
<i>Silas K. Jones</i>."
</p>

<p>
"He's struck a streak o' luck in his mind,"
said one of the seamen; "and it's this 'ere
hadmiral.  Now mark me, mates, I wouldn't be
that 'ere hadmiral for the worth of California.
Mr. Sir Blooming Hadmiral, K.C.B., et setterer,
is going to 'ave a time."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head over the melancholy fate
of a British admiral.
</p>

<p>
"Rot!" said one of the younger men; "'tain't
possible to do nothin' to the likes of an admiral.
Now, if 'twas a lieutenant or even a captain, I'm
not sayin' as Mr. Smith mightn't do somethin'.
But an admiral&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You mark me," said the older man, "I'd
rather be as green as grass and ship as an
able-bodied seaman with Billy Yates of the
<i>Wanderer</i>, than be in that hadmiral's shoes.
What do you say, Tom?"
</p>

<p>
Tom filled himself up a drink and considered.
</p>

<p>
"Wa'al," he answered after a long pause,
"it's my belief that it won't necessary be <i>all</i>
pie to be an admiral if the boss is half the man
he used to be.  For you see 'tis quite evident
he has a special kind of respect for this admiral,
and when Mr. Smith has been done by any one
that he respects, he don't ever forget.  Why,
you know yourselves that if one of you was
to do him, he'd forgive you right off after he'd
kicked the stuffing out of you."
</p>

<p>
This clear proof that Mr. Smith did not
respect them and was kind was received
without a murmur.  And as the boss did not
return, the tide of conversation drifted in the
narrower more personal channels of the marvels
that had happened in the "last ship."  And
in the meantime H.M.S. <i>Triumphant</i>, known
familiarly on the Pacific Coast station as "the
<i>Nonsuch</i>, two decks and no bottom," was bringing
Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Dunn, K.C.B.,
to his fate in San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
"Was there ever such luck&mdash;was there ever
such luck?" murmured Mr. Shanghai Smith.
"To think of him turnin' up, all of his own
accord, on my partic'lar stampin' ground!
And I'll lay odds he's clean forgot me.  I'll
brighten up his memr'y with sand and canvas
and souji-mouji, so I will!  Holy sailor, was
there ever such luck?"
</p>

<p>
The morning of the following day H.M.S. <i>Triumphant</i>
lay at her anchors off Saucelito in
San Francisco Bay, and was glad to be there.
For this was in the times when the whole British
fleet was not absolutely according to Cocker.
She leaked not a little and she rolled a great
deal, and she would not mind her helm except
upon those occasions when the officer in charge
of the deck laid his money and his reputation
on her going to starboard when, according to
all rules, she should have altered her course
to port.  But though she was a wet ship with
a playful habit of trying to scoop the Pacific
Ocean dry, and though her tricks would have
broken the heart of the Chief Naval Constructor
had he seen her at them, she was the flagship
in spite of her conduct, because at that time
she was half the whole Pacific Squadron.  The
other half was lying outside Esquimault Dry
Dock waiting for it to be finished.  And when
the <i>Chronicle</i> said that "Dicky Dunn" was the
admiral, it had not lied.  If any of that paper's
reporters had known "Dicky" as his men
knew him, he would have spread himself in a
column on the admiral's character and personal
appearance.
</p>

<p>
"He's the dead-spit of a boson's mate, to
be sure," said the crew of the <i>Triumphant</i> when
they received him at Esquimault.  "An 'ard
nut he looks!"
</p>

<p>
And a "hard nut" he certainly was.
Though he stood five feet nine in height, he
looked two inches less, for he was as broad
as a door and as sturdy as the fore-bitts.  His
complexion was the colour of the sun when
it sets in a fog for fine weather: the skin on
his hands shone and was as scaly as a lizard's
hide.  His teeth were white and his eyes
piercing.  He could roar like a fog-horn, and
sing, as the crew said, "like any hangel."  There
wasn't the match of "Dicky" on any
of the seas the wide world over.  The only
trouble was that he looked so much like the
traditional sailor and buccaneer that no one
could believe he was anything higher than a
warrant officer at the most when he had none
of his official gear about him.
</p>

<p>
Though the admiral did not know it, one
of the very first to greet him when he set
his foot on dry land at the bottom of Market
Street was the man he had licked so thoroughly
fifteen years before in Melbourne.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's the same," said Smith to his chief
runner, who was about the "hardest case" in
California.  "He ain't changed none.  Just
so old he was when he set about me.  Why, the
galoot might be immortal.  Mark him, now;
will you know him anywhere?"
</p>

<p>
"It don't pay me ever to forget," replied
the runner.  He had to remember the men
who owed him grudges.
</p>

<p>
"Then don't forget this one," said Smith.
"Do you find me a considerate boss?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well&mdash;&mdash;" said the runner ungraciously.
</p>

<p>
"You've got to do a job for me, Billy."
</p>

<p>
"And what?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm goin' to have this hyer admiral
shipped before the stick on the toughest ship
that's about ready to go to sea," replied Smith.
</p>

<p>
Billy flinched.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, it's the penitentiary!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't care if it's lynchin'," said Smith.
"Help&mdash;or get.  I'm bossin' this job.  Which
is it?"
</p>

<p>
And Billy, seeing that he was to play second
fiddle, concluded to help.
</p>

<p>
"And," he said to himself, "if we get
nailed I'll split.  Calls himself a 'considerate
boss.'  Well, Shanghai Smith has a gall!"
</p>

<p>
"Which do you reckon is the worst ship inside
the Gate now?" asked Smith, after he had
savoured his cunning revenge for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Harvester</i> ain't due for a month, sir."
</p>

<p>
Smith looked melancholy.
</p>

<p>
"No, she ain't, that's a fact.  It's a solid
pity.  Sant would have suited this Dunn
first class."  He was the most notorious
blackguard of a shipmaster yet unhung, and
the fact that Smith and he were bitter enemies
never blinded Shanghai to the surpassing merits
of his brutality.
</p>

<p>
"There's the <i>Cyrus G. Hake</i>."
</p>

<p>
Smith shook his head contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"D'ye think I want to board this admiral
at the Palace Hotel?  Why, Johnson hasn't
hurt a man serious for two trips."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, I thought as he'd sure break
out soon," said Bill; "but there's the President.
They do say that her new mate is a holy
terror."
</p>

<p>
"I won't go on hearsay," said Smith
decidedly.  "I want a good man you and I
know&mdash;one that'll handle this Dicky Dunn
from the start.  Now, what's in the harbour
with officers that can lick me?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I always allowed (as you know,
Mr. Smith) that Simpson of the <i>California</i> was
your match."
</p>

<p>
Smith's face softened.
</p>

<p>
"Well, mebbe he is."
</p>

<p>
At any other time he would never have
admitted it.
</p>

<p>
"And the <i>California</i> will sail in three days."
</p>

<p>
"Righto," said Smith.  "Simpson is a good
tough man and so is old Blaker.  Bill, the
<i>California</i> will do.  But it's an almighty
pity the <i>Harvester</i> ain't here.  I never knew
a more unlucky thing.  But we must put
up with the next best."
</p>

<p>
"But how'll you corral the admiral, sir?"
asked Bill.
</p>

<p>
"You leave that to me," replied his boss.
"I've got a very fruitful notion as will fetch
him if he's half the man he was."
</p>

<p>
Next evening Smith found occasion to run
across a couple of the <i>Triumphant's</i> crew,
and he got them to come into his house for a
drink.
</p>

<p>
"Are these galoots to be dosed and put
away?" asked the bar-tender.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," said Smith.  "Fill 'em up
with good honest liquor at my expense."
</p>

<p>
The bar-tender hardly knew where good
honest liquor was to be found in that house,
but he gave the two men-o'-war's men the
slowest poison he had, and they were soon
merry.
</p>

<p>
"Is the admiral as dead keen on fightin'
with his fists as he was?" asked Smith.
</p>

<p>
"Rather," said the first man.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, he's tired," said the second.  "'E
allows 'e can't find no one to lick 'im.  'E
never could."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's his complaint, is it?" said Smith.
"And is he as good as he was?"
</p>

<p>
"I heerd him tell the first luff on'y the
other day as 'e reckoned to be a better man
now than he was twenty years ago.  And I
believes 'im.  'Ard?  Oh my!  I do believe if
'e ran agin a lamp-post he'd fight through it."
</p>

<p>
It was enough for Smith to know that the
admiral was still keen on fighting.  To draw
a man like that would not be so difficult.
When he had turned the two naval seamen
into the street, he called for the runner.
</p>

<p>
"Have you found out what I told you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Bill.  "He mostly comes
down and goes off at eleven."
</p>

<p>
"Is he alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Mostly he has a young chap with him.  I
reckon they calls him the flag-lieutenant: a
kind of young partner he seems to be.  But
that's the only one so far.  And the <i>California</i>
sails day after ter-morrer, bright and early."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't be better," said Smith.  "After
waitin' all these years I can't afford to lose
no time.  Thishyer racket comes off to-night.
Look out, Mr. Bully Admiral!  I'm on your track."
</p>

<p>
And the trouble did begin that night.
</p>

<p>
Mr. 'Say-it-and-mean-it' Smith laid for
Admiral Sir Richard Dunn, K.C.B., etc., etc.,
from ten o'clock till half-past eleven, and he was
the only man in the crowd that did not hope
the victim would come down with too many
friends to be tackled.
</p>

<p>
"It's a penitentiary job, so it is," said Bill.
And yet when the time arrived his natural
instincts got the better of him.
</p>

<p>
The admiral came at last: it was about a
quarter to twelve, and the whole water-front
was remarkably quiet.  The two policemen
at the entrance to the Ferries had by some
good luck, or better management, found it
advisable to take a drink at Johnson's, just
opposite.  And the admiral was only
accompanied by his flag-lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
"That's him," said Smith.  "I'd know the
beggar anywhere.  Now keep together and sing!"
</p>

<p>
He broke into "Down on the Suwannee
River," and advanced with Bill and Bill's two
mates right across the admiral's path.  They
pretended to be drunk, and as far as three were
concerned, there was not so much pretence
about it after all.  But Smith had no intention
of being the first to run athwart the admiral's
hawse.  When he came close enough, he shoved
the youngest man right into his arms.  The
admiral jumped back, and landed that
unfortunate individual a round-arm blow that
nearly unshipped his jaw.  The next moment
every one was on the ground, for Bill
sandbagged the admiral just as he was knocked
down by the lieutenant.  As Sir Richard fell,
he reached out and caught Smith by the ankle.
The boarding-house master got the lieutenant
by the coat and brought him down too.  And
as luck would have it, the youngster's head
hit the admiral's with such a crack that both
lay unconscious.
</p>

<p>
"Do we want the young 'un too?" asked
Bill when he rose to his feet, swinging his
sand-bag savagely.  And Smith for once lost
his head.
</p>

<p>
"Leave the swine, and puckarow the
admiral," he said.  And indeed it was all they
could do to carry Sir Richard without exciting
any more attention than four semi-intoxicated
men would as they took home a mate who
was quite incapacitated.
</p>

<p>
But they did get him home to the house in
the Barbary Coast.  When he showed signs
of coming to, he was promptly dosed and
his clothes were taken off him.  As he slept
the sleep of the drugged, they put on a
complete suit of rough serge toggery and he
became "Tom Deane, A.B."
</p>

<p>
"They do say that he is the roughest, toughest,
hardest nut on earth," said Bill; "so we'll
sec what like he shapes in the <i>California</i>.  I
dessay he's one of that lot that lets on how
sailormen have an easy time.  It's my notion
the <i>California</i> will cure him of that."
</p>

<p>
By four o'clock in the morning, Tom Deane,
who was, as his new shipmates allowed, a
hard-looking man who could, and would, pull his
weight, lay fast asleep in a forward bunk of
the <i>California's</i> foc'sle as she was being towed
through the Golden Gate.  And his flag-lieutenant
was inquiring in hospital what had
become of the admiral, and nobody could tell
him more than he himself knew.  So much he
told the reporters of the <i>Chronicle</i> and the
<i>Morning Call</i>, and flaring headlines announced
the disappearance of a British admiral, and the
wires and cables fairly hummed to England
and the world generally.  At the same time
the San Francisco police laid every waterfront
rat and tough by the heels on the
chance that something might be got out of one of them.
</p>

<p>
"What did I tell you?" asked Bill in great
alarm, as he saw several intimate friends of his
being escorted to gaol.
</p>

<p>
"Are you weakenin' on it?" said Smith
savagely.  "If I thought you was, I'd murder
you.  Give me away, and when I get out, I'll
chase you three times round the world and
knife you, my son."
</p>

<p>
And though Bill was so much of a "terror,"
he could not face Smith's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I ain't in it, anyhow," he swore.
</p>

<p>
But certainly "Tom Deane, A.B." was in it,
and was having a holy time.
</p>

<p>
When the admiral woke, which he did after
half an hour's shaking administered in turns
by three of the <i>California's</i> crew, who were
anxious to know where he had stowed his
bottle of rum, he was still confused with the
"dope" given him ashore.  So he lay pretty
still and said:
</p>

<p>
"Send Mr. Selwyn to me."
</p>

<p>
But Selwyn was his flag-lieutenant, and was
just then the centre of interest to many
reporters.
</p>

<p>
"Send hell; rouse out, old son, and turn
to," said one of his new mates.  And the
admiral rose and rested on his elbow.
</p>

<p>
"Where am I?"
</p>

<p>
"On board the <i>California</i>, to be sure."
</p>

<p>
"I'm dreaming," said the admiral, "that's
what it is.  To be sure, I'm dreaming."
</p>

<p>
There was something in his accent as he
made this statement that roused curiosity in
the others.
</p>

<p>
"No, you ain't&mdash;not much," said the first
man who had spoken; "and even if you was,
I guess Simpson will wake you.  Rouse up
before he comes along again.  He was in
here an hour back inquiring for the trumpet
of the Day of Judgment to rouse you.  Come
along, Deane!  Now then!"
</p>

<p>
"My name's Dunn," said the admiral, with
contracted brows.
</p>

<p>
"Devil doubt it," said his friend; "and
who done you?  Was it Shanghai Smith?"
</p>

<p>
The admiral sat up suddenly, and by so
doing brought his head into violent contact
with the deck above him.  This woke him
thoroughly, just in time to receive Mr. Simpson,
mate of the <i>California</i>, who came in
like a cyclone to inquire after his health.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ship as a dead man?" asked Mr. Simpson,
"for if you did, I'll undeceive you."
</p>

<p>
And with that he yanked the admiral from
his bunk, and dragged him by the collar out
upon the deck at a run.  Mr. Simpson was
"bucko" to his finger-tips, and had never been
licked upon the high seas.  But for that matter
Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Dunn, K.C.B., had
never hauled down his flag either to any
man.  It surprised him, as it would have
surprised any of his crew, to find that he
took this handling almost meekly.  But then
no one knows what he would do if the sky
fell; and as far as the admiral was concerned,
the entire world was an absurd and ridiculous
nightmare.  He rose at the end of his
undignified progress and stared at the mate.
</p>

<p>
"Who&mdash;who are you?" he said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Simpson gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Who am I&mdash;oh, who am I?  Well, I'll
oblige you by statin' once for all that I'm
mate of this ship, and you're my dog."
</p>

<p>
But the "dog" shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing of the sort," he said, as he
staggered with the remains of the opiate.  "I'm
a British admiral, and my name's Sir Richard
Dunn.  Where's my ship?"
</p>

<p>
Any ordinary kind of back-answer or
insubordination received only one kind of
treatment on board the <i>California</i>, and when
a man had been beaten to a jelly, he rarely
recovered enough spirit to inquire why he
had been hammered.  But this was a new
departure in back-talk.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're an admiral&mdash;an admiral, heh?"
said Simpson.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Sir Richard, and a sudden
gust of rage blew the last opium out of him.
"Why, damn it, sir, what the devil do you
mean by laying your filthy paws on me?
Where's your captain, sir?  By all that's
holy, I'll smash you if you so much as look
at me again."
</p>

<p>
Now it is a remarkable fact that the utterly
and entirely unexpected will sometimes shake
the courage of the stoutest heart.  It is
possible that a tiger would itself turn tail if a
lamb rushed at him with open mouth.  And
though Mr. Simpson would have tackled a
prize-fighter, knowing he was a prize-fighter,
the fact that one of the kind of men whom
he was accustomed to wipe his boots on now
turned upon him with entirely strange language
and a still stranger air of authority, for a
moment daunted him utterly.  He stood still
and gasped, while the admiral strode aft and
went up the poop ladder.  He was met there
by the captain, who had been the terror of the
seas as a mate.  A narrow escape of a conviction
for murder had partially reformed him.
He had also become religious, and usually went
below when Simpson or the second "greaser"
was hammering any one into oblivion and
obedience.
</p>

<p>
"What is this?" asked Captain Blaker
mildly, yet with a savage eye.  "Mr. Simpson,
what do you mean by allowing your authority
(and mine delegated to you) to be disregarded?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said Mr. Simpson, and then the
admiral turned on him.
</p>

<p>
"Hold your infernal tongue, sir," he
roared.  "And, sir, if you are the master of
this vessel, as I suppose, I require you to put
about for San Francisco.  I am a British
admiral, sir; my name is Sir Richard Dunn."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're an admiral and you 'require'?"
said Blaker.  "Wa'al, I do admire!  You
look like an admiral: the water-front is full
of such.  Take that, sir."
</p>

<p>
And the resurgent old Adam in Blaker
struck the admiral with such unexpected force
that Dunn went heels over head off the poop
and landed on Simpson.  The mate improved
the opportunity by kicking him violently in
the ribs.  When he was tired, he spoke to the
admiral again.
</p>

<p>
"Now, you lunatic, take this here ball of
twine and go and overhaul the gear on the
main.  And if you open your mouth to say
another word I'll murder you."
</p>

<p>
And though he could not believe he was
doing it, Sir Richard Dunn crawled aloft, and
did what he was told.  He was stunned by
his fall and the hammering he had received,
but that was nothing to the utter and complete
change of air that he experienced.  As he
overhauled the gear he wondered if he was an
admiral at all.  If he was, how came he on the
maintopgallant-yard of a merchant ship?  If
he wasn't, why was he surprised at being there?
He tried to recall the last day of his life as
an admiral, and was dimly conscious of a late
evening somewhere in San Francisco at which
he had certainly taken his share of liquor.  A
vague sense of having been in a row oppressed
him, but he could recall nothing till he had
been yanked out of his bunk by that truculent
devil of a mate then patrolling the poop.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I must be mad," said the admiral.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, look alive there, you dead
crawling cat," said Mr. Simpson, "or I'll
come up and boot you off the yard.  Do you
hear me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the admiral quickly, and as
he put a new mousing on the clip-hooks of the
mizzen-topmast-staysail-tripping-line block, he
murmured: "I suppose I never was an admiral
after all.  I don't seem to know what I am."  And
the hardest nut among the admirals of the
Active List wiped away a tear with the sleeve
of his coat as he listened to the sacred
Commination Service with all its blessings, intoned
in a down-east twang by the eminent Mr. Simpson.
</p>

<p>
"He's crazy," said Simpson to the second
greaser.  "Says he's an admiral.  I've had the
Apostle Peter on board, and a cook who said
he was St. Paul, but this is the first time I've
run against an admiral before the mast."
</p>

<p>
"Does he look like it, sir?" asked Wiggins,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
"He looks the toughest case you ever set
eyes on," said Simpson.  "But you'd have
smiled to see the way the old man slugged him
off the poop.  And yet there's something
about him I don't tumble to.  I guess that's
where his madness lies.  Guess I'll cure him or
kill him by the time we get off Sandy Hook.&mdash;Now
then, you admiral, come down here and
start up the fore rigging, and do it quick, or
I'll know the reason why."
</p>

<p>
And the Knight Commander of the Bath
came down as he was bid, and having cast a
perplexed eye over Simpson and Wiggins, who
sniggered at him with amused and savage
contempt, he went forward in a hurry.
</p>

<p>
"This is a nightmare," he said; "I'm
dreaming.  Damme, perhaps I'm dead!"
</p>

<p>
When he had overhauled the gear at the
fore&mdash;and being a real seaman, he did it
well&mdash;Wiggins called him down to work on deck,
and he found himself among his new mates.
By now they were all aware that he believed
he was an admiral, and that he had spoken
to Simpson in a way that no man had ever
done.  That was so much to his credit, but
since he was mad he was a fit object of jeers.
They jeered him accordingly, and when they
were at breakfast the trouble began.
</p>

<p>
"Say, are you an admiral?" asked Knight,
the biggest tough on board except Simpson and
Wiggins.
</p>

<p>
And the admiral did not answer.  He
looked at Knight with a gloomy, introspective
eye.
</p>

<p>
"Mind your own business," he said, when
the question was repeated.
</p>

<p>
And Knight hove a full pannikin of tea
at him.  This compliment was received very
quietly, and the admiral rose and went on deck.
</p>

<p>
"Takes water at once," said Knight; "he
ain't got the pluck of a mouse."
</p>

<p>
But the admiral went aft and interviewed
Mr. Simpson.
</p>

<p>
"May I have the honour of speaking to
you, sir?" he said, and Simpson gasped a
little, but said he might have that honour.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," said Sir Richard Dunn, "I
don't know how I got here, but here I am,
and I'm willing to waive the question of my
being a British admiral, as I can't prove it."
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said Simpson.  "Ah, I'll have
you sane enough by-and-by, my man."
</p>

<p>
The admiral nodded.
</p>

<p>
"But I wish to have your permission to
knock the head off a man called Knight
for'ard.  It was always my custom, sir, to
allow fights on board my own ship when
I considered them necessary.  But I always
insisted on my permission being asked.  Have
I yours, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Simpson looked the admiral up and down.
</p>

<p>
"Your ship, eh?  You're still crazy, I'm
afraid.  But Knight can kill you, my man."
</p>

<p>
"I'm willing to let him try, sir," said the
admiral.  "He hove a pannikin of tea over
me just now, and I think a thrashing would
do him good and conduce to the peace and
order of the foc'sle."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you think so," said Simpson.  "Very
well, you have my permission to introduce
peace there."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, sir," said the admiral.
</p>

<p>
He touched his hat and went forward.  He
put his head inside the foc'sle and addressed
Knight:
</p>

<p>
"Come outside, you bully, and let me knock
your head off.  Mr. Simpson has been kind
enough to overlook the breach of discipline
involved."
</p>

<p>
And Knight, nothing loth, came out on
deck, while Simpson and Wiggins stood a
little way off to enjoy the battle.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to back the admiral," said Wiggins.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have a level five dollars on Knight,"
said Simpson, who remembered that he had,
on one occasion, found Knight extremely
difficult to reduce to pulp.
</p>

<p>
"Done with you," said Wiggins.
</p>

<p>
And in five minutes the second mate was
richer by five dollars, as his mates carried
Knight into the foc'sle.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know when I enjoyed myself
more," said Simpson, with a sigh&mdash;"even
if I do lose money on it.  While it lasted
it was real good.  Did you see that most
be-ewtiful upper cut?  And the right-handed
cross counter that finished it was jest superb.
But I'll hev to speak to the victor, so I will."
</p>

<p>
And he addressed the admiral in suitable
language.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think, because you've licked
him, that you can fly any flag when I'm around.
You done it neat and complete, and I overlook
it, but half a look and the fust letter of a
word of soss and I'll massacre you myself.
Do you savvy?"
</p>

<p>
And the admiral said:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
He touched his cap and went forward to
the foc'sle to enter into his kingdom.  For
Knight had been "topside joss" there for
three voyages, being the only man who had
ever succeeded in getting even one pay-day
out of the <i>California</i>.  The principle on which
she was run was to make things so hot for
her crew that they skipped out at New York
instead of returning to San Francisco, and
the fresh crew shipped in New York did the
same when they got inside the Golden Gate.
</p>

<p>
"I understand," said the admiral, as he stood
in the middle of the foc'sle, "that the
gentleman I've just had the pleasure of knocking
into the middle of next week was the head
bully here.  Now I want it thoroughly understood
in future that if any bullying is to be
done, I'm going to do it."
</p>

<p>
All the once obedient slaves of the deposed
Knight hastened to make their peace with the
new power.  They fairly crawled to the admiral.
</p>

<p>
"You kin fight," said one.
</p>

<p>
"I knew it jest so soon as you opened yer
mouth," said another.  "The tone of yer voice
argued you could."
</p>

<p>
"It's my belief that he could knock the
stuffin' out o' Mr. Simpson," said the third.
</p>

<p>
"'Twould be the best kind of fun," said
another admirer of the powers that be, "for
Blaker would kick Simpson in here, and give
the admiral his job right off.  He's got
religion, has Blaker, but he was an old packet
rat himself, and real 'bucko' he was, and
believes in the best men bein' aft."
</p>

<p>
And though the admiral said nothing to
this, he remembered it, and took occasion to
inquire into its truth.  He found that what
he knew of the sea and its customs was by
no means perfect.  He learnt something every
day, and not least from Knight, who proved
by no means a bad sort of man when he had
once met his match.
</p>

<p>
"Is it true," asked the admiral, "what they
say about Captain Blaker giving any one the
mate's job if he can thrash him?"
</p>

<p>
"It used to be the custom in the Western
Ocean," said Knight, "and Blaker was brought
up there.  He's a real sport, for all his bein'
sort of religious.  Yes, I'll bet it's true."  He
turned to the admiral suddenly.  "Say, you
wasn't thinkin' of takin' Simpson on, was you?"
</p>

<p>
"If what's you say's true, I was," said the
admiral.  "It don't suit me being here."
</p>

<p>
"Say now, partner," put in Knight, "what's
this guff about your being an admiral?  What
put it into your head?"
</p>

<p>
And Sir Richard Dunn laughed.  As he
began to feel his feet, and find that he was
as good a man in new surroundings as in the
old ones, he recovered his courage and his
command of himself.
</p>

<p>
"After all, this will be the deuce of a joke
when it's over," he thought, "and I don't see
why I shouldn't get a discharge out of her as
mate.  Talk about advertisement!"
</p>

<p>
He knew how much it meant.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Knight," he said aloud, "I am
an admiral.  I can't prove it, but my ship was
the <i>Triumphant</i>.  I don't want to force it down
your throat, but if you'd say you believe it, I
should be obliged to you."
</p>

<p>
Knight put out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I believes it, sonny," he said, "for I
own freely that there's suthin' about you
different from us; a way of talk, and a look
in the eye that ain't formiliar in no foc'sle as
I ever sailed in.  And if you was lyin', how
come you to lie so ready, bein' so drunk when
Simpson hauled you out o' yer bunk?  No, I
believe you're speakin' the trewth."
</p>

<p>
And Sir Richard Dunn, K.C.B., shook hands
with Charles Knight, A.B.
</p>

<p>
"I won't forget this," he said huskily.  He
felt like Mahomet with his first disciple.
"And now, in confidence," said the admiral,
"I tell you I mean to have Simpson's job by
the time we're off the Horn."
</p>

<p>
"Good for you," cried Knight.  "Oh, he
kicked me somethin' cruel the time him and
me had a turn-up.  Give it him, old man.
And here's a tip for you.  If you get him
down, keep him down.  Don't forget he kicked
you, too."
</p>

<p>
"I don't forget," said Sir Richard&mdash;"I
don't forget, by any means."
</p>

<p>
Yet he did his duty like a man.  Though
many things were strange to him, he tumbled
to them rapidly.  One of his fads had been
doing ornamental work even when he was an
admiral, and he put fresh "pointing" on the
poop ladder rails for Blaker in a way that
brought every one to look at it.  There was
no one on board who could come within sight
of him at any fancy work, and this so pleased
Simpson that the admiral never had a cross
word till they were south of the Horn.  Then
by chance the mate and the captain had a few
words which ended in Simpson getting much
the worst of the talk.  As luck would have it,
the admiral was the handiest to vent his spite
on, and Simpson caught him a smack on the
side of his head that made him see stars.
</p>

<p>
"Don't stand listenin' there to what don't
concern you, you damned lazy hound," he said.
And when the admiral picked himself off the
deck, Simpson made a rush for him.  The
admiral dodged him and shot up the poop
ladder.  He took off his cap to the captain,
while Simpson foamed on the main-deck and
called him in vain.  At any other time Blaker
would have gone for the seaman who dared
to escape a thrashing for the moment by
desecrating the poop, but now he was willing
to annoy Simpson.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you want?" he roared.
</p>

<p>
The admiral made a really elegant bow.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I wanted to know whether
Western Ocean custom goes here.  I've been
told that if I can thrash your mate, I shall
have his job.  They say forward that that's
your rule, and if so, sir, I should like your
permission to send Mr. Simpson forward
and take his place."
</p>

<p>
There was something so open and ingenuous
in the admiral that Captain Blaker, for the
first time on record, burst into a shout of
laughter.  He went to the break of the poop
and addressed the mate.
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear, Mr. Simpson?" he inquired genially.
</p>

<p>
"Send him down, sir," said Simpson.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure you can pound him?"
</p>

<p>
Simpson gritted his teeth and foamed at the
mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Kick him off the poop, sir."
</p>

<p>
The admiral spoke anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a first-class navigator, sir.  Is it a
bargain?"
</p>

<p>
And Blaker, who had never liked Simpson,
laughed till he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Are you willing to stake everything on
your fightin' abilities, Mr. Simpson?"
</p>

<p>
And when Simpson said "Aye" through
his teeth, the admiral jumped down on the
main-deck.
</p>

<p>
Now, according to all precedents, the fight
should have been long and arduous, with
varying fortunes.  But the admiral never
regarded precedents, and inside of ten seconds
Mr. Simpson was lying totally insensible under
the spare topmast.  To encounter the admiral's
right was to escape death by a hair's-breadth,
and it took Charles Simpson, Able Seaman
(<i>vice</i> Mr. Simpson, Chief Officer), two hours
and a quarter to come to.
</p>

<p>
"And I thot he could fight," said the
disgusted skipper.  "Come right up,
Mr. What's-your-name; you're the man for me.
There ain't no reason for you to trouble
about my second mate, for Simpson could
lay him out easy.  All I ask of you is to
work the whole crowd up good.  And I don't
care if you are an admiral, you are the right
sort all the same.  I guess that Simpson must
have reckoned he struck a cyclone."
</p>

<p>
And Blaker rubbed his hands.  Like
Simpson at the fight between the admiral
and Knight, he did not know when he had
enjoyed himself more.  He improved the
occasion by going below and getting far too
much to drink, as was his custom.  And the
promoted admiral took charge of the deck.
</p>

<p>
"Ability tells anywhere," said Sir Richard
Dunn.  "I didn't rise in the service for
nothing.  Ship me where you like, and I'll
come to the top.  If I don't take this hooker
into New York as captain and master, I'll
die in the attempt."
</p>

<p>
He had quite come to himself and was
beginning to enjoy himself.  His natural and
acquired authority blossomed wonderfully when
he took on the new job, and as Blaker never
swore, the admiral's gift of language was a
great vicarious satisfaction to him.  Wiggins
accepted the situation without a murmur.
Even Simpson himself bore no malice when
his supplanter not only showed none, but
after knocking the boson's head against a
bollard, gave his place to the former mate.
Though he kept the men working and got
the last ounce out of them, none of them
were down on him.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you he's an admiral, sure," they said.
</p>

<p>
"He's got all the ways of one, I own," said
Bill, an old man-o'-war's man.  "I spoke to an
admiral myself once, or rather he spoke to me."
</p>

<p>
"What did he say?" asked the rest of
his watch.
</p>

<p>
"He said," replied Bill proudly&mdash;"he upped
and said, 'You cross-eyed son of a dog, if
you don't jump I'll bash the ugly head off
of you.'  And you bet I jumped.  Oh, he's
all the ways of some admirals, he has."
</p>

<p>
"Well, admiral or none," said the rest of
the crowd, "things goes on pleasanter than
they done when you was mate, Simpson."
</p>

<p>
And Simpson grunted.
</p>

<p>
"And he gets more work out of us than
you done either, Simpson, for all your
hammerin' of us."
</p>

<p>
"I'll likely be hammerin' some of you again
shortly," said Simpson.  And as he was cock
of the walk in the foc'sle, whatever he was in
the ship, the others dried up.
</p>

<p>
Nothing of great interest happened till they
were well east of the Horn and hauled up
for the northward run.  And then Blaker
took to religion (or what he called religion)
and rum in equally undiluted doses.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a miserable sinner, I am," he said to
the admiral, "but all the same, I'll do my
duty to the crowd."
</p>

<p>
He called them aft and preached to them
for two hours.  And when one man yawned,
he laid him out with a well-directed belaying
pin.  The next day, when it breezed up heavily
and they were shortening sail, he called all hands
down from aloft on the ground that their
souls were of more importance than the work
in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Come down on deck, you miserable sinners,"
said Blaker through a speaking trumpet.  His
voice rose triumphantly above the roar of the
gale.  "Come down on deck and listen to
me.  For though I'm a miserable sinner too,
there's some hopes for me, and for you there's
none unless you mend your ways, in
accordance with what I'm telling you."
</p>

<p>
Even with the speaking trumpet he could
hardly make himself heard over the roar of
the increasing gale and the thunderous slatting
of the topsails in the spilling-lines.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think, sir, that they'd better
make the topsails fast before you speak to
them?" said the admiral.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't," replied Blaker&mdash;"not much
I don't, not by a jugful.  For if one of 'em
went overboard, I'd be responsible before the
throne.  And don't you forget it."
</p>

<p>
"Damme, he's mad," said Sir Richard&mdash;"mad
as a march hare.  She'll be shaking the
sticks out of her soon."
</p>

<p>
He leant over the break of the poop, and
called up Wiggins.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Wiggins, one word with you."
</p>

<p>
Wiggins came up, as Blaker roared his text
through the trumpet.
</p>

<p>
"Will you stand by me, Mr. Wiggins, if
I knock him down and take command?"
</p>

<p>
"I will; but mind his gun," said Wiggins.
"When he's very bad, he'll shoot."
</p>

<p>
It was not any fear of Blaker's six-shooter
that made the admiral hesitate.  To take the
command, even from a madman, at sea is a
ticklish task and may land a man in gaol, for
all his being a Shanghaied admiral.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, Mr. Wiggins, that Simpson is
a good man.  I'll bring him aft again."
</p>

<p>
And Wiggins made no objection when
Simpson was called up by the admiral.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Simpson," said the mate, "this is
getting past a joke.  Have you any objection
to taking on your old job if I secure this
preaching madman and take command?"
</p>

<p>
Simpson was "full up" of the foc'sle, and
as he had a very wholesome admiration for
the admiral, he was by no means loth to
return to his old quarters.
</p>

<p>
"I'm with you, sir.  In another quarter of
an hour we shall have the sticks out of her."
</p>

<p>
And still Blaker bellowed scripture down
the wind.  He was still bellowing, though
what he bellowed wasn't scripture, when
Simpson and Wiggins took him down below after
five minutes of a row in which the deposed
captain showed something of his ancient form
as the terror of the Western Ocean.  As they
went, the admiral, now promoted to being
captain of a Cape Horner, picked up the
battered speaking trumpet and wiped some
blood from his face, which had been in
collision.
</p>

<p>
"Up aloft with you and make those topsails
fast," he roared.  "Look alive, men, look
alive!"
</p>

<p>
And they did look alive, for "Dicky" Dunn
never needed a speaking trumpet in any wind
that ever blew.  When things were snugged
down and the <i>California</i> was walking north at
an easy but tremendous gait, he felt like a
man again.  He turned to Simpson and Wiggins
with a happy smile.
</p>

<p>
"Now we're comfortable, and things are as
they should be, Mr. Simpson, let the men have
a tot of grog.  And how's Mr. Blaker?"
</p>

<p>
"Wa'al," said Simpson cheerfully, "when
we left him he warn't exactly what you would
call religious nor resigned."
</p>

<p>
But if Blaker was not happy, the admiral
was thoroughly delighted.
</p>

<p>
"Now you see what I said was true," he
declared at dinner that night; "if I hadn't been
an admiral and a man born to rise, how could
I have been shipped on board this ship as a
foremast hand and come to be captain in six
weeks?  I'll be bound you never heard of a
similar case, Mr. Simpson."
</p>

<p>
And Simpson never had.
</p>

<p>
"Was it Shanghai Smith, do you think, as
put you here?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The admiral had heard of Shanghai Smith
in the foc'sle.
</p>

<p>
"When I get back I'll find out," he said.
"And if it was, I'll not trouble the law,
Mr. Simpson.  I never allow any man to handle
me without getting more than even."
</p>

<p>
"You don't," said Simpson.  If his manner
was dry, it was sincere.
</p>

<p>
"But I don't bear malice afterwards.  Your
health, Mr. Simpson.  This kind of trade
breeds good seamen, after all.  But you are all
a trifle rough."
</p>

<p>
Simpson explained that they had to be.
</p>

<p>
"When the owners' scheme is to have one
man do three men's work, they have to get
men who will make 'em do it.  And when the
owners get a bad name and their ships a worse,
then men like Shanghai Smith have to find us
crews.  If you could get back to San Francisco
and hammer an owner, some of us would be
obliged to you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, when I get back!" said the admiral.
"This will be a remarkable yarn for me to tell,
Mr. Simpson.  I still feel in a kind of dream.
Would you oblige me by going to Mr. Blaker
and telling him that if he continues to hammer
at that door I'll have the hose turned on him."
</p>

<p>
And when Simpson went to convey this
message, the admiral put his feet on the table
and indulged in a reverie.
</p>

<p>
"I'll make a note about Shanghai Smith,
and settle with him in full.  But I shall rise
higher yet.  I know it's in me.  Steward!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the steward.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'll have some grog."
</p>

<p>
He drank to the future of Admiral Sir
Richard Dunn, master of the <i>California</i>.

<h3>
THE SETTLEMENT WITH SHANGHAI SMITH.
</h3>

<p>
It is easy to understand that there was
something more than a flutter in shipping
circles in San Francisco, to say nothing of the
sailors' boarding-houses, when a telegram
reached that city from New York which was
expanded as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
"<i>THE LOST ADMIRAL.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
"<i>Admiral Sir Richard Dunn, whose mysterious
disappearance in San Francisco three months ago
caused such great excitement, has arrived at New
York in command of the ship </i>California<i>.  He was, it
appears, assaulted, and drugged, and put on board
that vessel, and owing to a series of exciting incidents
during the passage, finally took charge of her.  The
admiral is in good health.  He states that he has
no idea who was responsible for the outrage.</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The bar-tender at Shanghai Smith's house
was the first to spot this cable.  He put his
hand on the bar and vaulted it.
</p>

<p>
"Say, Billy, see this."
</p>

<p>
He shook up the runner who was taking
a caulk on a hard bench, having been engaged
between four and six in getting three drunken
men on board the <i>Wanderer</i>.  It is often
easier to get a dozen amenable to reason than
three, just as it is easier to handle many sheep
than few.  He was very tired and sulky.
</p>

<p>
"Well, wo'd's up now?" he grunted.
</p>

<p>
"Hell is up, and flamin'," said Tom.
"You ain't forgot the admiral by any chance,
now?"
</p>

<p>
Billy woke as suddenly as if he had been
sleeping on the look-out and had been found
hard and fast by the mate.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, what, has the <i>California</i> turned up?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet she has," said Tom.  And he
burst into laughter.  "What d'ye reckon
he was on board of her when she came to
N' York?"
</p>

<p>
"Cook's mate?"
</p>

<p>
"No, captain, captain!  Think of that.
And he says he don't know who laid him
out and put him aboard of her."
</p>

<p>
Billy rose.
</p>

<p>
"Here, gimme the paper.  You're drunk."
</p>

<p>
He read the telegram with protruding eyes.
</p>

<p>
"By the holy frost, but he must be a dandy,
Say, Smith must know this."
</p>

<p>
He marched to Smith's bedroom and induced
his boss to sit up and hear the news, after
Smith had used more bad language with his
eyes shut than most men in San Francisco could
lay their tongues to when wide awake.
</p>

<p>
"Don't I tell you it's about the admiral,"
expostulated Billy; "it's about Dunn, as you
shoved on the <i>California</i>."
</p>

<p>
But now Shanghai was wide awake.  He
looked at Billy with wicked eyes.
</p>

<p>
"As <i>I</i> shoved in the <i>California</i>, eh?  Say
that again and I'll get up and knock the
corners off of you.  You miserable Tarhead, if
I hear you whisper that I had the last joint
of the little finger of my left hand in the game,
I'll murder you."
</p>

<p>
Billy fell back from the bed in alarm.
Though he looked big enough to have eaten
Shanghai Smith, he lacked the "devil" which
had made his boss what he was&mdash;the terror
of the "coast" and of sailormen, and a political
power in his quarter of the city.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well then, Mr. Smith, but who done it?"
</p>

<p>
"Understand that no one knows who done
it, you dog," said Smith, reaching for what
he called his "pants," "but if any one done
it, it was you.  And don't you forget it.  I
hire you to do the work, and I'll see you does
it.  Don't get me mad, or you'll be runnin'
to the penitentiary howlin' for ten years to
get away from me."
</p>

<p>
And Billy went back to Tom.
</p>

<p>
"He's fair luny, that's what he is.  But
if he reckons I'm goin' to the calaboose for
him, he'll run up agin a snag."
</p>

<p>
And presently Smith came out to breakfast
with a face as black as a near cyclone.  Billy
and Tom jumped when he spoke, and all
those men in his house who were in a lee
shore, as regards dollars, got away from him
and adorned a neighbouring fence.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong wiv Shang'ai?" asked a
Londoner; "'es a black 'un, but I never seed
'im so rorty as this!"
</p>

<p>
And no one answered him.  They were a
sick crowd at any time, and now, when their
slave-owner roared, their hearts were in their
boots.
</p>

<p>
But Smith was only trying to keep up his
own courage.  Not once, but many times since
he had got even with the man who had given
him a thrashing, he had regretted his method of
revenge.
</p>

<p>
"I'd best have bashed him and left him
laying on the Front," said Smith, "and here's
Tom and Bill know the whole racket.  I've
half a mind to have them put out of the way.
In such a place as this, who <i>can</i> a man trust?
Bah, it sickens me, it does.  It fair sickens me."
</p>

<p>
He was virtuously indignant with an
ungrateful world.  Even his revenge had been
a failure.  How in the name of all that was
holy and unholy had the admiral managed to
rise from the foc'sle to the command of the
<i>California</i>?
</p>

<p>
"And I thought Blaker and Simpson was
both men!" said Smith with disgust.  "There
ain't any trustin' to appearances, nor to
reputation neither.  But how could the swine have
done it?"
</p>

<p>
An early evening paper had the whole story,
and as Shanghai was still up town, all his crowd
of crimps and slaves roared over the yarn.
</p>

<p>
"He fo't the mate and was give 'is billet,"
said one.  "I say, but old Blaker was a sport.
That's real old Western Ocean packet law.
And then Blaker went luny with psalm singing
and the hadmiral locked 'im up.  'Strewth, but
it must 'ave bin a picnic!  I'd 'ave give a
month's wages to see the show.  But 'oo was
it shang'aied a hadmiral?"
</p>

<p>
He spoke with bated breath.
</p>

<p>
"Who'd it be but Smith?" asked the
speaker's mate sulkily.  "He's a devil, a
notorious devil, as <i>we</i> know.  He'd shanghai
his father for a quarter, if he was dry.  And
a month back my own brother that shipped in
the <i>Cyrus J. Brown</i> told me as Shanghai had a
down on this very man."
</p>

<p>
"Then I wouldn't be Smith for all 'is money.
This'll be a Government business."
</p>

<p>
It would have been if the admiral had been
any other kind of man.  But Admiral Sir
Richard Dunn was one of those, and they
get rarer every day, who prefer handling their
own affairs.  He had a gift of humour, too, and
was mightily pleased with himself.
</p>

<p>
"Whoever it was that laid for me, he never
meant to make me master of the <i>California</i>,"
he said, as he came west on the cars.  "And
whoever he was, I will fix him.  The mate
was pretty certain it was this Shanghai Smith.
If it was&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
If it was, it seemed a healthy thing for
Mr. Smith to leave San Francisco and hide
somewhere in the Islands.  But all his
interests kept him where he was, even when
H.M.S. <i>Triumphant</i> came down again from
Esquimault and lay waiting for the admiral off
Goat Island.
</p>

<p>
The crew of the <i>Triumphant</i>, being very
proud of their own special admiral, were in
so furious a rage against any one connected
with crimping in the city, that no "liberty" was
granted to any one of them.
</p>

<p>
"It's hall very fine," said the <i>Triumphants</i>
unanimously, "but these 'ere Americans are
too smart by 'alf.  Them and hus'll part brass-rags
one of these fine days.  But ain't it fine
to think that Dicky went to sea as a man
before the stick, and come out right on top?"
</p>

<p>
They chortled with exceeding pleasure,&mdash;with
pleasure founded on his achievements
and on the unexpected experiences he had had
of sea-life.
</p>

<p>
"To think of Dicky bunking it among a
crowd of merchant Jacks," said the crew.
"We'd give a lot to 'ave seen him shinning up
aloft for dear life."
</p>

<p>
But all the same, they loved him dearly, and
when he came alongside five days later, not
all their sense of discipline prevented their
breaking into a storm of cheers that rang out
across the bay and was almost heard at Oakland.
Hard as Dicky Dunn was, he went to his
cabin rather in a hurry.  For once in his life
he could hardly trust himself to speak.  But
he received the congratulations of the captain
and officers, including young Selwyn, who had
been with him when he had been kidnapped,
with the greatest calm.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I've had some experience," he said,
"and I don't know that it has done me any
harm.  I know more of the conditions on
board merchant vessels than I did before."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you propose to do, Sir
Richard?" asked Selwyn an hour later.  "The
authorities and the police seemed very anxious
to do what they could."
</p>

<p>
The admiral lighted one of his own cigars,
and found it more to his taste than the ship's
tobacco of the <i>California</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I don't propose to trouble the police,"
he said, "nor need there be any international
correspondence so far as I'm concerned.  I'll
play my own game.  I think, Selwyn, that I
know who laid for us that night.  And from
what I learnt in the <i>California</i> (I learnt a lot,
by the way) I've a notion that ordinary justice
would never get hold of the man, at least not
in San Francisco, not even if I paid for it."
</p>

<p>
"Then what&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Dicky Dunn interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"I've a notion," he said significantly.
</p>

<p>
And that afternoon he sent Selwyn ashore
with a very polite note to the chief of the San
Francisco police, saying that Rear-Admiral Sir
Richard Dunn would be very glad to see that
gentleman on board the <i>Triumphant</i> late that
evening, if he could make it convenient to
come.
</p>

<p>
"Let the band begin to play!" said Mr. Peter
Cartwright; "it looks as if I'd better face
the music.  I wonder if he has any kinkle as
to the man who did it?  It's more than I have,
unless it was Smith, or Sullivan."
</p>

<p>
As he drew his five thousand dollars a year
and pickings partly through the grace of
both the notorious boarding-house keepers that
he mentioned, he did not relish running against
them.  Nevertheless, it was better to do that
than run against a mightier snag.  He looked,
with a groan, at the pile of correspondence
which had accumulated since the admiral's
disappearance.
</p>

<p>
"And here's the British Consul wants to
see me to-morrow!" he cried.  "They'll cinch
me if they can get no one else."
</p>

<p>
And he went on board the <i>Triumphant</i> feeling
as if he was out of a job.
</p>

<p>
The admiral received him courteously, and
was alone.
</p>

<p>
"This has been a bad business, admiral, sir,"
said Mr. Cartwright, "and as chief of police
of this city I feel it as a personal slur.  Your
request to see me anticipated me by no more
than twelve hours.  I proposed to seek an
interview with you to-morrow morning."
</p>

<p>
"I am obliged to you," said the admiral.
"Will you have anything to drink?"
</p>

<p>
"It <i>was</i> rather cold on the water," replied
Cartwright.
</p>

<p>
And when the chief of police had a tumbler
of hot whiskey and water in both hands, the
admiral opened up.
</p>

<p>
"I've sent for you, Mr. Cartwright," he
began, "to tell you that I don't want any
proceedings taken about this matter."
</p>

<p>
Cartwright opened his mouth and stared at
the admiral in surprise.  Then he began to
imagine he understood.  Sir Richard Dunn
had evidently been somewhere on the night of
his disappearance which would not suit him to
have known.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I see," said Cartwright, with a subtle
smile.
</p>

<p>
"I've my own notions as to the brand of
justice dispensed in this State, Mr. Cartwright.
It is considerably milder than the native liquors.
I want your assistance in doing without the law,
and in administering justice myself.  Have you
any notion of the gentleman who shipped me
in the <i>California</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"It was probably a boarding-house master,"
said Cartwright.
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"It might have been Sullivan, or the Sheeny,
or Williams, or Smith."
</p>

<p>
"Is that the scoundrel they know here as
Shanghai Smith?" asked the admiral.
</p>

<p>
And Cartwright nodded.
</p>

<p>
"The crew of the <i>California</i> put it down to
him at once."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know that it was necessary him,"
said Cartwright pensively; "though he has the
worst name, he's no worse than the others.
For my own part, I reckon the Sheeny&mdash;he's
a Jew boy, of course&mdash;is a deal tougher than
Smith."
</p>

<p>
And just then Selwyn, who knew the chief
of police was on board, put his head into the
admiral's cabin.
</p>

<p>
"Could I speak to you a moment, Sir Richard?"
</p>

<p>
And Dicky Dunn went outside.
</p>

<p>
"I thought as you had this Cartwright with
you, sir," said Selwyn, "that I ought to tell
you a queer yarn that has just been brought
me by one of the quartermasters.  It seems
that one of the men has a story that you once
had a fight with Shanghai Smith and hurt him
badly.  It was in Australia I believe&mdash;in
Melbourne."
</p>

<p>
"Stay a minute," said the admiral; "let me
think.  Yes, by Jove, I did have a row on
Sandridge Pier years ago, and I broke the man
up so that he had to go to a hospital.  And
his name&mdash;yes, it <i>was</i> Smith.  Thanks, Selwyn,
I'll see if this man ever was in Australia."
</p>

<p>
He went back to Cartwright
</p>

<p>
"Now as to the Sheeny, admiral," said Cartwright,
who was beginning to feel comfortable.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind the Sheeny, Mr. Cartwright,"
said his host; "do you know Smith's record?
Where did he come from?"
</p>

<p>
"He came from Melbourne," replied the chief.
</p>

<p>
And the admiral slapped his leg.
</p>

<p>
"That's the man, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind why," said Dunn.  "But supposing
it was, could we prove it against him?"
</p>

<p>
"I doubt it," said Cartwright cheerfully.
"Probably no one would know it but his
runner.  And Bill Haines would perjure
himself as easy as drink lager."
</p>

<p>
"But if we did prove it?"
</p>

<p>
"There'd be an appeal, and so on," said the
chief.
</p>

<p>
He indicated large and generous delay on the
part of the merciful American law by a wave of
his hand.
</p>

<p>
"You see we couldn't prove, anyhow, that
he knew you was you," said Cartwright, "and
if I know my own business, it would come
down to a matter of assault and so many
dollars."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I imagined," said the admiral.
"So I propose to take the matter in hand
myself and relieve you of it.  For though
Smith, or the real man, might come off easily,
if I choose to have it made an international
business some one will have to pay who is
not guilty."
</p>

<p>
"That's likely enough," said Cartwright
uneasily.  "On the whole, admiral, I'd rather
you took the job on yourself, provided it was
put through quietly.  What do you propose?"
</p>

<p>
Dunn put his hands in his pockets, and
"quarter-decked" his cabin.
</p>

<p>
"I want to be sure it's Smith&mdash;morally sure.
How can I be made sure?  I'll tell you
now what I know about him."
</p>

<p>
He repeated what Selwyn had said, and
told him the story of his having fought a
man on Sandridge Pier at Melbourne fifteen
years before.
</p>

<p>
"His name was Smith."
</p>

<p>
"It fits as neat as a pair of handcuffs," said
the chief of police.  "I'll think over it and let
you know.  Stay, sirree, I've got it now.
Look here, admiral, now you mark me.  This
is a scheme.  It'll work, or my name's Dennis.
I'll have it put about in the right quarter that
though there ain't evidence to touch the real
man who worked the racket on you, it is
known who actually corralled you and shoved
you on the <i>California</i>.  I'll get the proper man
to give it away that a warrant is being made
out.  And next day I'll have all the runners
of all the chief boarding-houses arrested.  Do
you see?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't," said the admiral.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come," cried Cartwright.  "The
man we don't arrest will be the man who
done it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Cartwright, "I understood
you didn't particularly hanker to catch the
under-strapper."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said the admiral, "of course I see.
You mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I mean the boarding-house boss will shove
the runner that did it out of sight.  And
then you'll know him by reason of the very
means he takes not to be given away.  For
of course he'd reckon that the runner on being
held would squeal."
</p>

<p>
"It's a good plan," said the admiral.  "And
when I know, what kind of punishment would
Mr. Smith like least of all?"
</p>

<p>
"Provided you remember he's an American
citizen, I don't care what you do," replied
the chief.  "But if you asked me, I should
get him served the way he's served you.
Shanghai Smith among a crowd of sailormen
in an American ship, such as the <i>Harvester</i>
(and the skipper of the <i>Harvester</i> hates him
like poison)&mdash;and <i>she</i> sails in three days&mdash;would
have a picnic to recollect all his life.  For
you see, they know him."
</p>

<p>
"I'll think it over," said the admiral.
"Your plan is excellent.
</p>

<p>
"So it is," said Cartwright, as he was rowed
ashore, "for Smith ain't no favourite of mine,
and at the same time it will look as if I
gave him the straight racket, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
He sent an agent down to the water front
that very night.  The man dropped casual
hints at the boarding-houses, and he dropped
them on barren ground everywhere but at
Shanghai Smith's.
</p>

<p>
"Jehoshaphat," said Smith, "so that's the game!"
</p>

<p>
Peter Cartwright had, in his own language,
"reckoned him up to rights"; for the very first
move that Smith played was to make a break
for Billy's room.  As the runner had been
up most of the night before enticing sailormen
off a Liverpool ship just to keep his hand
in, he was as fast asleep as a bear on
Christmas Day, and he was mighty sulky when
Smith shook him out of sleep by the simple
process of yanking his pillow from under his
head.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't a man to get no sleep that works
for you?" he demanded.  "What's up now?"
</p>

<p>
"Hell is up, and fizzling," replied Smith.
"I've had word from Peter Cartwright that
you'll be arrested in the mornin' if you don't
skin out.  It's the admiral.  I wish I'd never
set eyes on him.  Come, dress and skip:
'twon't do for you to be gaoled; mebbe they'd
hold you on some charge till you forgot all
you owe to me.  There ain't no such thing
as real gratitude left on earth."
</p>

<p>
Billy rose and shuffled into his clothes
sullenly enough.
</p>

<p>
"And where am I to skip to?"
</p>

<p>
"To Portland," said Smith; "the <i>Mendocino</i>
leaves in the mornin' for Crescent City and
Astoria, don't she?  Well, then, go with her
and lie up with Grant or Sullivan in Portland
till I let you know the coast is clear.  And
here's twenty dollars: go easy with it."
</p>

<p>
He sighed to part with the money.
</p>

<p>
"I'd sooner go down to Los Angeles,"
grunted Billy.
</p>

<p>
But Smith explained to him with urgent
and explosive blasphemy that he was to get
into another State in order to complicate legal
matters.
</p>

<p>
"You've the brains of a Flathead Indian,
you have," said Smith, as he turned Billy into
the street on his way to find the <i>Mendocino</i>.
"What's the use of havin' law if you don't
use it?"
</p>

<p>
And in the morning, when Smith heard that
ten runners at least had been urgently invited
to interview Mr. Peter Cartwright, he was glad
to be able to declare that Billy was not on
hand.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone East to see his old man," he
said drily.  "And as his father is a millionaire
and lives in the Fifth Avenue, N' York, he
couldn't afford to disregard his dyin' desire to
see him."
</p>

<p>
"You are a daisy, Smith," said the police
officer who had come for Billy.  "Between you
and me, what have you done with him?"
</p>

<p>
Smith shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I shot him last night and cut him up and
pickled him in a cask," he said with a wink.
"And I've shipped him to the British
Ambassador at Washington, C.O.D."
</p>

<p>
"You're as close as a clam, ain't you,
Smith?  But I tell you Peter is havin' a
picnic.  This admiral's game was playin' it low
down on Peter, whoever did it.  There are
times when a man can't help his friends."
</p>

<p>
Smith lied freely.
</p>

<p>
"You can tell Peter I had nothin' to do
with it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I can <i>tell</i> him!" said the police
officer.  And he did tell him.  As a result the
chief of police wrote to the admiral:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"SIR,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
"I have interrogated all the runners but one
belonging to the chief boarding-houses, and have
succeeded in obtaining no clue.  The one man
missing was runner to Mr. William Smith,
commonly known as 'Shanghai' Smith.  Under the
circumstances, and considering what you said to
me, I am inclined to wait developments.  If you
will inform me what you wish me to do, I shall be
glad to accommodate you in any way."
</p>

<p class="letter">
  "Yours truly,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PETER CARTWRIGHT.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
"P.S.&mdash;If you could write me a letter saying you
are quite satisfied with the steps I have taken to
bring the offender to justice, I should be obliged.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"P.S.&mdash;If you wish to meet Mr. John P. Sant,
captain of the <i>Harvester</i>, now lying in the bay
and sailing the day after to-morrow, I can arrange it."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But both the postscripts were written on
separate pieces of paper.  Mr. Cartwright was
not chief of police in a land of justice for
nothing.  He knew his way about.
</p>

<p>
Dicky Dunn, on receiving Peter's letter,
called in his flag-lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
"When they shanghaied me, they knocked
you about rather badly, didn't they, Selwyn?"
</p>

<p>
Selwyn instinctively put his hand to the
back of his head.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Sir Richard.  They sand-bagged me,
as they call it, and kicked me too."
</p>

<p>
"I'm pretty sure I know who did it," said
the admiral, "and I'm proposing to get even
with the man myself.  It seems that it will
be a difficult thing to prove.  Besides, I'm not
built that way.  I don't want to prove it and
send the man to gaol.  I like getting even in
my own fashion.  What would you do if I
could tell you who it was that laid the plot
against us that night?"
</p>

<p>
Selwyn was a clean-skinned, bright-eyed,
close-shaven young fellow, as typical an
Anglo-Saxon salted in the seas as one could meet.
His eyes sparkled now.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I'd punch his head, sir."
</p>

<p>
The admiral nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I believe I did punch his head, years ago,
Selwyn.  But he was looking for a fight and
found it, and ought to have been satisfied.
Between you and me and no one else, the chief
of police here and I have fixed this matter
up between us.  He says that he has no
evidence, and the only man who might have
given the affair away has been shipped off
somewhere.  I'm going to show Mr. Smith
that he didn't make a bucko mate of me for
nothing.  And I want you to help.  I've
got a scheme."
</p>

<p>
He unfolded it to Selwyn, and the young
lieutenant chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"He used to be a seaman," said the admiral,
"but for twelve years he's been living comfortably
on shore, sucking the blood of sailors.
And if I know anything about American ships&mdash;and
I do&mdash;he'll find three months in the
fo'castle of this <i>Harvester</i> worse than three
years in a gaol.  Now we're going to invade
the United States quite unofficially, with the
connivance of the police!"
</p>

<p>
He lay back and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I tell you," said the admiral, "he
ran against something not laid down in his
chart when he fell in with me.  You can
come ashore with me now and we'll see this
Cartwright.  American ways suit me, after all."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Then I understand, Mr. Cartwright," said
the admiral, an hour later, "that there won't
be a policeman anywhere within hail of this
Smith's house to-morrow night?"
</p>

<p>
"I've got other business for them," said Peter.
</p>

<p>
"And I can see Mr. Sant here this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll undertake to have him here if you
call along at three."
</p>

<p>
He spent the interval at lunch with the British Consul.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you what, Stanley," said the admiral,
"I don't care what they did to me, for it's
done me no harm.  But after this you should
be able to make them enforce the laws.  If
they would only do that, the Pacific Coast
wouldn't stink so in the nostrils of shipmasters
and shipowners."
</p>

<p>
The consul explained the local system of
politics.  It appeared that every one with any
business on the borders of crime insured
against the results of accidents by being in politics.
</p>

<p>
"And if the thieving politicians appoint the
man to control them, what's the result?"
</p>

<p>
"The result is&mdash;Shanghai Smith," said the
admiral.  "Well, I'll see you later.  I've an
appointment with Mr. Sant, of the <i>Harvester</i>."
</p>

<p>
The consul stared.
</p>

<p>
"What, with Sant?  Why, he got eighteen
months' hard labour for killing a man six
months ago."
</p>

<p>
"But he's not in prison?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," said the consul.  "He
was pardoned by the Governor."
</p>

<p>
"He's just the man I wish to see," cried Dicky Dunn.
</p>

<p>
He found Sant waiting at Cartwright's
office.  He was a hard-bitted, weather-beaten
gentleman, and half his face was jaw.  That
jaw had hold of a long cigar with his
back teeth.  He continued smoking and
chewing, and did both savagely.  What Peter
had said to him did not come out, but by
agreement the admiral was introduced as Mr. Dunn.
</p>

<p>
"You have reason not to like Shanghai
Smith?" said Peter.
</p>

<p>
"That's so," nodded Sant.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Dunn does not like him either.
Could you make any use of him on board the
<i>Harvester</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"I could," said Sant, grinning; "he'd be
a useful man."
</p>

<p>
"If you imagined you missed a man to-morrow
morning just as you were getting up
your anchor, and some one hailed you and
said they had picked one up, you would take
him aboard?"
</p>

<p>
"Wet or dry," said Sant.
</p>

<p>
"I'll undertake he shall be wet," said the
admiral.  "Eh?"  And he turned to Selwyn.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," replied the lieutenant, "that
could be arranged."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Mr. Sant," said the admiral.
</p>

<p>
"And it's understood, of course," said
Peter, "that you gentlemen never saw each
other and don't know each other when you
meet, it being a matter of mutual obligation."
</p>

<p>
"I agree," said Sant.  And the admiral
shook hands with a gentleman who had been
pardoned by an amiable Governor.
</p>

<p>
"And of course," Cartwright added as he
escorted the admiral and Selwyn into the
passage, "if there <i>should</i> be a shindy at Smith's
and any of your men are in it, we shall all
explain that it was owing to your having been
put away.  And two wrongs then will make
it right.  I guess the newspapers will call it square."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly so," said the admiral.
</p>

<p>
And when he reached the <i>Triumphant</i> he had
very nearly worked out the plan by which
the row at Shanghai Smith's was to occur.
</p>

<p>
"I'll just go over it with you, Selwyn," he
said, when he reached his cabin again.  "Now
you must remember I rely on your discretion.
A wrong step may land us in trouble with the
authorities and the Admiralty.  There never
was a Government department yet which
wouldn't resent losing a fine chance of a paper
row, and if they catch me settling this matter
out of hand, my name is Dennis, as the
Americans say.  And I don't want your name
to be Dennis either."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you propose, Sir Richard?"
asked Selwyn.
</p>

<p>
"This is rightly your show and mine," said
the admiral.  "I won't have any one else in
it, that I can help.  I ought to speak to
Hamilton, but I won't.  I'll keep him out of
the trouble"&mdash;for Hamilton was the captain
of the <i>Triumphant</i>.  "I suppose the men here
<i>are</i> really fond of me?" said the admiral
interrogatively.
</p>

<p>
"They have no monopoly of that," said Selwyn.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any one of them you could drop
a hint to, that you could trust?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Selwyn; "there's Benson,
whose father works for mine as gardener.
We used to fight in the toolhouse at home,
and now he would jump overboard if I asked him."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean Benson, my coxs'n?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"He's the very man.  You might let him
know that if he should get into any trouble,
he will be paid for it.  I leave the rest to
you.  You can go ashore now, with this
note to Stanley.  That will give you a chance
to take Benson with you and speak to him
on the quiet.  I don't know that I care
particularly to hear any more about it till
the day after to-morrow, unless I have to.
Ultimately all the responsibility is mine, of
course."
</p>

<p>
And by that Selwyn understood rightly
enough that Dicky Dunn, for all his cunning,
had no intention of shirking trouble if trouble
came.  He went ashore and took Benson up
town with him.
</p>

<p>
"Do the men think it was Shanghai Smith
that laid for us, and put the admiral away,
Benson?" he asked as they went up Market Street.
</p>

<p>
"There ain't the shadder of a doubt 'e done
it, sir," said Benson.
</p>

<p>
"And they don't like it?"
</p>

<p>
"Lord bless you, sir.  It's very 'ard 'avin'
all liberty stopped, but between you and me
it was wise to stop it.  They would 'ave rooted
'is 'ouse up and shied the wreckage into
the bay."
</p>

<p>
"It's a pity that you and about twenty
more couldn't do it," said Selwyn.  "And if
one could only catch hold of the man himself
and put him on board an outward-bound ship,
it would do him good."
</p>

<p>
Benson slapped his leg.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir, there ain't a man on board the
<i>Triumphant</i> that wouldn't do six months with
pleasure to 'ave the 'andlin' of 'im."
</p>

<p>
"No?"
</p>

<p>
"For sure, sir."
</p>

<p>
  I was lying awake last night thinking of it,"<br />
said Selwyn; "at least, I believe I was
awake&mdash;perhaps I was dreaming.  But I seemed to
think that a couple of boats' crews were
ashore, and that you went to Shanghai's place
for a drink."
</p>

<p>
"I've done that same, sir," said Benson,
"and the liquor was cruel bad."
</p>

<p>
"And I dreamed&mdash;yes, I suppose it was a
dream&mdash;that you started a row and made hay
of his bar and collared him, and took him in
the cutter and rowed him round the bay till
about four in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"You always was very imaginary and dreamy
as a boy, sir, begging your pardon, sir," said
Benson.
</p>

<p>
"And I dreamed you came to the <i>Harvester</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Her that's lying in the bay&mdash;the ship
with the bad name among sailormen?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the ship," said Selwyn; "and you
hailed her and asked the captain if a man had
tried to escape by swimming.  And he said
'Yes,' and then you said you'd picked him up."
</p>

<p>
Benson looked at him quickly.
</p>

<p>
"But he wouldn't be wet, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, he would, Benson.  You could
easily duck him over-board."
</p>

<p>
Benson stared very hard at the lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  I could very easy duck him&mdash;and
love to do it, too.  And did the captain
of the <i>Harvester</i> own to him, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Selwyn nodded.
</p>

<p>
"He would, Benson&mdash;I mean he did, of course."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," asked Benson, with his eyes
on the pavement, "that it had been arranged so?"
</p>

<p>
"In the dream, yes," said the lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
"Was it for to-morrow evening, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought so," said Selwyn.  "And the
curious thing about it was that the whole thing
was done as quietly as possible.  All you men
went to work in silence without as much as
a hurrah.  And one of the boats brought me
ashore and the other brought the admiral.
And it was only after you had put the man
on board the <i>Harvester</i> that you came back
for the admiral at five in the morning, Benson."
</p>

<p>
"And what about the boat as brought you, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I came back at twelve and went on board
with them, after the fight, and while you were
rowing Mr. Smith about the bay, cheering
him up."
</p>

<p>
"Was there anything else, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Selwyn, "only that I
forget whether it came out.  If it did, the men
said it was a game all of their own.  And I
think&mdash;no, I'm sure&mdash;that if any one got into
trouble it paid him well, after all."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it would, sir," said Benson
warmly.  "I wish it could really come off.
You never know your luck, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I think Mr. Smith doesn't," said Selwyn.
</p>

<p>
And when Benson went on board again
and had a long confabulation with two boats'
crews, there was a unanimous opinion among
them that Mr. Smith had piled his ship up
with a vengeance when he ran against a
British admiral.
</p>

<p>
"There ain't to be no weepons," said Benson&mdash;"nothin'
worse nor more cuttin' than a stay-sail
'ank as a knuckle-duster, and even that I
don't recommend.  An odd stretcher or two
and the bottles there will do the job.  And
the word is silence, now and then."
</p>

<p>
"Mum's the word," said the men.  And
like the children that they were, they wrought
the whole ship's company into a frenzy of
excitement, by dropping hints about as heavy
as a half-hundredweight on every one who
was not in the game.  Had there been much
longer to wait than twenty-four hours, they
must have told, or burst.  And if they had
not burst, the others would have finally reached
the truth by the process of exhaustion.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was nine o'clock on the following evening
that the admiral went on shore to dine with
the British consul.  He told Benson that he
might be later than eleven.  And as Benson
touched his cap he took the liberty of believing
he might be as late as five in the morning.
And just about eleven Selwyn came ashore in
another boat with papers which had to go to
the admiral.  That is what he said to the first
lieutenant.  Captain Hamilton was sleeping the
night at the house of a cousin of his in San
Francisco.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be back in an hour, Thomas," said
Selwyn.  And the two coxs'ns were left in
command of the cutting-out expedition.  The
whole business was nearly wrecked at the
outset by the settlement of the question as to
who was to be left in charge of the boats.
Finally Thomas and Benson ordered two men
to stay, and the defrauded men sat back and
growled most horribly as the rest moved off
towards Shanghai Smith's in loose order.
</p>

<p>
"Look 'ere," said Billings to Graves as they
were left alone, "it's hobvious one must stay
with the boats; but one's enough, and on an
hexpedition like this, horders ain't worth a damn.
I'll howe you a quid, a whole quid, and my
grog for a month if you'll be the man to stay."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll toss you, the same terms both sides."
</p>

<p>
And the spin of coin sent Billings running
after the rest.  He was received by Benson
with curses, but he stuck to the party all the same.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, you report me!  You know
you can't," he said defiantly.  "And I've give
Graves a thick 'un and my grog for a month
to be let come."
</p>

<p>
This awful sacrifice appealed even to Benson.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said.  "But if I can't
report you for this, I can the next time."
</p>

<p>
"Next time be damned," cried Billings;
"'oo cares about next time, now?"
</p>

<p>
And they hove in sight of Shanghai Smith's.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time a bluejacket had been
near the place since a day or two before the
admiral's disappearance.  And at first when
Shanghai saw them come in he regretted that
Billy, his best fighting man, was by now well
on his way to Portland.  But for at least ten
minutes the <i>Triumphants</i> behaved very well.
Benson had a good head and had arranged
matters very neatly.
</p>

<p>
"You look 'ere," he had said; "the thing
to look out for is the barman.  He keeps a
gun, as they calls it 'ere, on a shelf under the
bar.  Smith, 'e'll 'ave one in his pocket.  So
when I says, 'This rum would poison a dog,'
don't wait for no back answer, but lay the
bar-keeper out quick, with a stone matchbox
or anything 'andy.  And the nearest to Smith
does the same to 'im.  He'll likely not be
be'ind, but if 'e is, bottle 'im too, and not a
word of jaw about it first or last."
</p>

<p>
They stood up to the bar, and Benson
ordered drinks for himself and three particular
pals of his.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't this Mr. Smith's?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'm Smith," said Shanghai.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere's to you.  I've often heard of you,"
said Benson.  And three or four merchant
seamen sitting about the room sniggered and
passed a few sneering remarks among
themselves about "Liberty Jack."
</p>

<p>
Smith, who had taken enough that night to
make him rash, referred to the admiral.
</p>

<p>
"So your admiral has come back, has he?"
</p>

<p>
"He has," said the <i>Triumphants</i>.  "And
Dicky Dunn is lookin' for the man that
played that dirty game on him."
</p>

<p>
And Smith shrugged his shoulders as he
half turned away.
</p>

<p>
"'Tain't half so dirty as this rum," said
Benson; "it would poison a dog."
</p>

<p>
And as the words left his mouth the ball
opened with a sudden and tremendous crash.
Two heavy matchboxes went for Tom behind
the bar: one laid him out as quietly as if he
had been hocussed; the other smashed a bottle
which held a liquor known on the Barbary
Coast as brandy, and starred the mirror behind
the shelves.  Thomas at the same moment
stooped and caught Shanghai Smith by the
ankles and pitched him on his head.  He never
had time to reach for his "gun."  The
merchant seamen jumped to their feet and
made for the door.
</p>

<p>
"Stop them!" said Benson, and half a dozen
bluejackets hustled them back again.  "No
you don't, Johnnies; you can stay and 'ave
free drinks, and look after the man behind the
bar.  Drag out that Smith and get 'im in the
open air."  And Thomas dragged Smith into
the darkness by his collar.
</p>

<p>
"There's to be no drinkin' for us," said
Benson.  "Smash what you like, and taste
nothin'."  And in less than a minute Shanghai's
place was a lamentable and ghastly spectacle.
</p>

<p>
"Sarves him right," said one of the merchant
seamen, as he salved a bottle of poison.  "Oh,
ain't he a sailor-robbing swine?"
</p>

<p>
"Fetch him in and let him look at it," said
Benson, with a wink.
</p>

<p>
Thomas had been primed.
</p>

<p>
"He's come to and run like billy-oh!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
But Smith was incapable of running.  He
was being carried by two bluejackets.
</p>

<p>
"After 'im, after 'im," said Benson; and
in another moment the whole house was dear.
</p>

<p>
When Tom came to, he found the place a
wreck, and four boarders too far gone in free
liquor to offer any useful explanation of what
had occurred since the rum had been pronounced
fit to poison a dog.
</p>

<p>
"All I know is," said the soberest, "that
he fit and we fit and fit and fit, and then 'e run."
</p>

<p>
And when Tom sought for the police, it was
very odd that there was not one to be found
in the quarter of San Francisco which most
needs clubbing to keep it in order.  There
was not even one to bear witness that a crowd
of bluejackets and an American citizen had
come along the water front at midnight.  But
five minutes after midnight a British lieutenant
could have taken his oath that both crews were
in their boats and at least moderately sober.
</p>

<p>
"I've seen the admiral, Benson," said Selwyn,
as he stepped into his boat and sat down, "and
he may be later than he said."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, sir," replied Benson.
</p>

<p>
And as soon as Selwyn had disappeared into
the darkness, the boat with Mr. Shanghai Smith
in followed suit.  And the bay of San Francisco
is not so well policed that they had any one
inquiring what they were doing as they pulled
across to Saucelito, and laid up quietly till three
o'clock.
</p>

<p>
"He ain't dead, we hopes," said the crew of
the boat.
</p>

<p>
"Not 'e," said Benson; "'is 'eart beats all
to rights, and 'is head is perfectly sound, bar a
lump the size of a 'en's egg.  That up-endin'
dodge of Thomas's is very fatal in a row&mdash;oh,
it's very fatal."
</p>

<p>
It was nearly two o'clock before Shanghai
made any motion.  But when he did begin
to get conscious, he found his mind and his
tongue with surprising rapidity.
</p>

<p>
"That 'ead of yourn must be made of five-eighths
boiler-plate, Mr. Smith," said Benson, as
Smith sat up suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"What am I doin' here?" asked Smith.
</p>

<p>
"'Ow do we know?" asked the delighted
crew.  "You <i>would</i> come.  It warn't no good
excusin' of ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Smith put his hand to his head.
</p>

<p>
"Who hit me?" he demanded savagely.
</p>

<p>
"No one," said the crew unanimously; "you
tried to stand on your 'ead."
</p>

<p>
"Put me ashore," said Smith.  "What are
you goin' to do?"
</p>

<p>
"We're waitin' to see the <i>'Arvester</i> yonder
'eave 'er anchor up," replied Benson.  "We're
in the sailor-supplyin' line, we are, same as you
was."
</p>

<p>
"He don't like to hear that," said Billings;
"we're cutting him out of a job.  And this
time we ain't supplyin' admirals."
</p>

<p>
"No, we ain't.  Yah, you man-buyin', sailor-robbin'
swine!  And 'twas you dared touch our
admiral.  Oh, you dog, you!"
</p>

<p>
They all took a turn at him, and Smith saw
he was in the tightest corner he had ever
occupied.  This was satisfactorily expressed for
him.
</p>

<p>
"Say, Shanghai, did you ever hear of Barney's
bull?"
</p>

<p>
And when Smith refused to answer, they
answered for him.
</p>

<p>
"He was jammed in a clinch, and so are
you.  You're goin' to 'ave the finest time of
all your life.  Did you ever 'ear of Sant of the
<i>'Arvester</i>?"
</p>

<p>
And Smith, for all his brutal courage, shook
in his boots.
</p>

<p>
"I'll give you chaps a hundred dollars to
put me ashore," he cried.  "I never touched
Sir Richard Dunn."
</p>

<p>
"Dry up," said Benson, "and don't lie.
We wouldn't part with you, my jewel, not
for a thousand.  What made you desert from
the <i>'Arvester</i>, a comfortable ship like that, with
sich a duck of a skipper?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll give you a thousand," said Smith desperately.
</p>

<p>
"At four o'clock you're goin' on the
<i>'Arvester</i>&mdash;and 'tis nigh on three now.  Sant
wouldn't miss a man like you, so smart and
'andy, for all the gold in Californy.  Own
up as you shanghaied the admiral?"
</p>

<p>
Smith grasped at any chance of avoiding
the <i>Harvester</i>.  For Sant had a dreadful name,
and both his mates were terrors.
</p>

<p>
"If I own I put him away, will you take
me ashore and hand me over to the police?"
</p>

<p>
He was almost in a state of collapse.
</p>

<p>
Benson looked at the man, and in the faint
light of far-off day still below the horizon
the boat's crew saw him wink.
</p>

<p>
"We'll vote on it, if you owns up.  What
d'ye say, chaps?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, we'll vote," said the men.  "Say,
did you do it?"
</p>

<p>
But Smith saw how the voting would go,
and refused to speak.  They heard six bells
come across the water from many ships.  And
then they heard seven.  There was a grey
glint in the east.  The sand-dunes on the
verge of the Ocean Park whitened as they
pulled for the <i>Harvester</i>.  They heard the
clank of her windlass brakes and the bull
voice of her mate, as he encouraged his men
to do their best by threatening them with three
months of hell afloat.
</p>

<p>
Smith offered Benson two thousand dollars.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't part with you except to Sant
for all you ever robbed men of," said
Benson&mdash;"and what that is, on'y you knows.  Pull,
boys; her cable's up and down.  No, hold on
a moment; he must be wet, of course."
</p>

<p>
In spite of his struggles they put him over
the side and soused him thoroughly.  When
they pulled him on board again, he sat cursing.
</p>

<p>
"Now, boys, bend your backs."
</p>

<p>
And when he came up alongside the <i>Harvester</i>
she was just moving under the draught
of her loosed topsails.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Harvester</i>, ahoy!" cried Benson.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo!" said Sant.  "What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't happen to have lost one of
your crew, tryin' to desert by swimmin', sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Have you picked him up?  What's his
name, does he say?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Smith, sir."
</p>

<p>
"That's the man," said Sant.  "I want him
badly."
</p>

<p>
But Smith cried out:
</p>

<p>
"This is kidnappin', Mr. Sant.  I refuse
to go."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Smith," said Sant, "I'll take all the
chances of it's bein' anythin' you like.  Throw
them a rope."
</p>

<p>
And the <i>Triumphants</i> towed alongside.
</p>

<p>
"Up you go," said Benson.
</p>

<p>
"I won't," said Smith.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you?" asked Benson.  "We'll see
about that.  Hook on there, Billings."
</p>

<p>
And the next moment Smith was jammed
in a running bowline round his waist.
</p>

<p>
"Sway him up," said Benson; and the
crew of the <i>Harvester</i> hoisted the notorious
robber with about the only feelings of pleasure
they were likely to know till they reached
New York.  And the <i>Triumphants</i> pushed off
as they heard the mate address Mr. Smith
in language which did his reputation and the
reputation of the ship most ample justice.
</p>

<p>
"There's talk and there's a fore-topsail-yard-ahoy
voice for you," said Benson.  "Oh, Mr. Smith
will be looked after, he will.  Now,
chaps, pull for it, or the admiral will be waitin',
and if that 'appens, 'twill be 'Stand from
under.'"
</p>

<h3>
THE POLICY OF THE <i>POTLUCK</i>.
</h3>

<p>
Concerning the permanent and immutable
characteristics of ships, the
unhappy man who has never had his limited
range of vision broadened by a trip in a sailing
ship must of necessity know little.  He
probably falls into the fallacy, common even
among those who follow the sea, that a partial
or entire clearance of her "crowd" will quite
alter her nature; whereas sailors being sailors&mdash;that
is, people of certain fairly definite
attributes&mdash;any given environment makes them much the
same as those who preceded them.
</p>

<p>
But entire changes in the <i>personnel</i> of a vessel
rarely take place.  The officers change, but
the crew remains: the crew goes, but officers
stay.  Or more frequently some few men are
favourites of one or two of the officers, and
they mingle with the new crew like yeast, till
the ancient fermentation is visible once more.
</p>

<p>
Ships (to speak thus of their companies)
talk of the same subjects over a million miles of
changing seas: they have a permanent stock
of subjects.  These include all which are
perennially of interest to seafaring men, such
as homes <i>versus</i> boarding-houses, but they
include also something more individual,
something more intimately connected with the
essence of that particular vessel.  And the one
unending topic of interest on board the <i>Potluck</i>
was foreign politics.
</p>

<p>
How this came about no one knew, though
many theories were set afloat and sunk again
every Sunday afternoon.  Some said that the
first captain of the <i>Potluck</i> was called
Palmerstone, and that he introduced the subject of
England <i>versus</i> the world as soon as he
came on board.  Others swore that they had
been told by a clerk in the employ of the firm
that there had been a discussion over her very
keel concerning the introduction into her frame
of foreign oaks.
</p>

<p>
"This was the way of it," said Jack Hart,
who was the chief upholder of this particular
theory, and the son of a little shipbuilder&mdash;"the
lot that built her at Liverpool was the mixedest
crowd of forsaken cranks as ever handled
timber.  So the clerk said.  And one had
a hankerin' for teak and another for hoak
(with odd leanin's now and agin for Hafrican
and Portugee and French hoak), and another
he said 'Cuban Sabicu,' and another's word was
'Hackmatack' and 'chestnut' hevery time.
So they shoved in bits here and bits there
till she was a reg'lar junk-shop o' samples.
And that's the reason she's a foreign talking
argument ship.  And a mighty good reason too."
</p>

<p>
The crowd listened in silence.
</p>

<p>
"If you knew as much about arguin' as
you know (<i>seemin'ly</i>) about timbers as no man
ever heerd of, your argument might stand,"
said Mackenzie, a withered old foc'sle man.
"But it ain't to reason as the natur' of the
woods in a ship should make us talk this way
or that.  If so be a ship was built o' teak,
d'ye think we'd talk the 'jildy jow,' you black
'son of a gun' lingo?"
</p>

<p>
Hart shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No ship ain't never built all of teak as
I ever heerd of, and so your eye's out, Mac.
But a man with 'arf an eye could see the
knowledge of her bein' so built might lead
right hup to talk about the stren'ths of
the countries as well of the vally of their
timbers."
</p>

<p>
"So they might," said the almost convinced
crowd.  "Now Jack Hart 'as the gift, so to
speak, of seein' through things."
</p>

<p>
"And once started, who'd stop it?" asked
Jack triumphantly.  "I knowed a ship as 'ad
fresh crowd after fresh crowd in her, but she
for ever 'ad a black cat aboard.  And they
talked 'cat' to make you sick.  And I knowed
another as 'ad from launch to her hultimate
pilin' up in the Bermudas the fashion of calling
the skipper the 'Guffin.'  And hevery skipper
was the 'Guffin,' new and old, go or stay.
But when we broke hoff to hargue, why,
we was talkin' about them French jossers
and whether Sallis-bury was a-goin' to let 'em
chip into our game and straddle the Nile."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," said the crowd, and the
House was rough.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the skipper, or "old man"
(who henceforward, by the way, was called
the "Guffin"), and his two mates were
discussing the latest aspect of world politics,
as they drank whiskey and water.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong with Salisbury," said the
Guffin, who was as stout as a barrel and
as sturdy, "is, that he ain't got a
backbone.  He just lets 'em blow him about
like so much paper.  What he wants is
stiffenin': he's like a sprung spar.  That's
what he's like."
</p>

<p>
The mate, a tough-looking dog with hair
like anæmic tussac grass in patches on his face,
shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I've a greater opinion of him, captain, than
you have.  All his double shuffle is cunning.
It's getting back so's to lead them French on.
Mark me, he'll play them yet a fair knock-out."
</p>

<p>
The Guffin sneered.
</p>

<p>
"He may have cunnin', Lampert, but he
ain't no real tact.  Now, diplomatic tact, I take
it, is not givin' way into the gutter, but just
showin' as you're a nice pleasant-spoken chap
as don't mean to be put on.  It's my good
opinion as these foreigners don't yearn to
fight us.  And men like you and me, Lampert,
gets to learn the way of handlin' foreigners.
Who has so much experience with 'em as them
in command of English ships?"
</p>

<p>
"That's so," said the second mate, who
had been listening.  "Now last v'y'ge in the
<i>Battleaxe</i>, there was a Dago in my watch as
come from the betwixt and between land where
Spain jines France.  And he was the Dagoest
Dago I ever sailed with.  But I knew the
breed, and the first time he opens his garlicky
mouth I hauled off and hit him.  And then
I took his knife away and snapped the point
off.  And I says to him, 'Now, you black
beggar, every time at muster you'll show me
that knife, and there'll be peace in the
land.'  And he done so, and there was peace."
</p>

<p>
The captain (or "Guffin") smote his thigh.
</p>

<p>
"You're right, Simcox, you're right, and if
Salisbury was to take a leaf out of your
log-book in respects of handlin' Dagoes, 'twould be
better for all concerned.  But no, not him.
He goes on seein' them French make a fleet
and he lets 'em!  He actually sees 'em with
their fleet sharpenin' on the grindstone and
never says from the poop, 'Chuck that overboard,
you swine, or I'll come and 'andle you
so's you'll be glad to die.'"
</p>

<p>
The second mate was much gratified, as
was obvious by his standing first on one foot
and then on another.  But Lampert was not
so pleased.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you talk&mdash;you, captain and you,
Simcox&mdash;as if they had a fleet.  Why, it's my
opinion&mdash;and experts say 'ditto' to me there&mdash;that
a string o' band-boxes with crackers in
'em, and all on a mud-flat, would do as much
harm as the French fleet&mdash;unless they blows
up when we takes 'em."
</p>

<p>
The Guffin shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know, Lampert, as I never 'ad
no opinion of their fleet.  But that ain't the
question.  Salisbury may have 'is reasons for
not takin' it away, though I fails to see 'em;
but the real question is, why we don't have a
man with guts and go in command.  It's
my firm belief as there's many a merchant
captain as could work the diplomatic game to
better hadvantage.  Look at the experience
we has, dealing with owners contrary as hell,
and with consignees and with 'arbour-masters
and pilots.  Where Salisbury is wrong, is in
his not goin' about and freshin' up his mind.
And he works by rule o' thumb and dead
reckoning.  It ain't no wonder we can see
where's his eye's out."
</p>

<p>
"It ain't," said the compliant Simcox.
</p>

<p>
"Well," sighed Lampert, "I owns freely
as I don't feel that sure I'd like to run his
show."
</p>

<p>
The Guffin laughed.
</p>

<p>
"But you ain't 'ad my experience yet,
Lampert.  Now, I'd hundertake to come right
down into the harena, and make them
French and Germans sit up like monkeys on
a horgan while I played the tune."
</p>

<p>
"I believe you," said Simcox, rubbing his
hard hands.
</p>

<p>
"Look at the difficulties we 'as to contend
with," said the skipper, with a rapidly thickening
utterance and an increasing loss of aspirates&mdash;"look
at the vig'lance we 'as to use.  Rocks
<i>and</i> shoals <i>and</i> hother ships.  It's 'igh education
to be a master-mariner, and the Board of Trade
knows it&mdash;knows it well.  This 'ere crowd's
all English except that one Dutchman, but if
so be we'd English and Dagoes, and Dutchmen
and Calashees, I'd 'ave showed you
and Salisbury 'ow to 'andle mixed sweets.
Vig'lance, difficulties, bright look-out, and the
rule o' the road.  And look at the chart!
That's me!"
</p>

<p>
And very shortly afterwards the triple
conversation ceased, for the captain lay snoring
in his cabin.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Potluck</i> was a barque of eleven hundred
tons' register, and was bound for Adelaide, with
a general cargo of all mixed things under
heaven and on earth.  Now she was engaged
in running down her easting, and, as her skipper
believed, was somewhere about Lat. 44° 30' S.,
Long. 50° E., and not far off the Crozets.
The westerly winds were blowing hard, but
had the worst chill of winter off, for the
month was September.  Nevertheless, as old
Jones, the skipper, was on a composite track,
with a maximum latitude of 45° S., and was
bound farther south still it might have been to
the advantage of all concerned if he had drunk
less, talked little, and minded his own business
instead of arguing foreign politics.
</p>

<p>
But to each man Fate often gives his chance
of proving what he boasts to be his particular
skill in the universe.
</p>

<p>
When Lampert relieved Simcox at midnight,
the weather was thick, and neither man's
temper was of the sweetest, so they had a
bit of a breeze.
</p>

<p>
"What kind of a relief d'ye call this?'
growled Simcox.
</p>

<p>
"I call it a very good relief," replied
Lampert, "and a darned sight better one
than you deserve.  You owe me ten minutes
even now."
</p>

<p>
He looked down the scuttle at the clock.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you owe me twenty."
</p>

<p>
Simcox flew out with pretended politeness.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, make it half an hour!  Don't let's
haggle about such a trifle.  What's it matter
if I stand here waiting?  Can't I keep the
whole bloomin' watch for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Go to hell," said Lampert sulkily.
</p>

<p>
And Simcox went below.
</p>

<p>
"To be a sailor is to be a natural born
fool," said Lampert, addressing the bitter and
unkindly elements at large, "and to be on
board a ship with such a windy gassing crowd,
from the old man down to the cook, is very
trying.  It's very trying."
</p>

<p>
The wind took off a little later, but the
weather was still thickish.
</p>

<p>
"It's like lookin' through a haystack,"
grunted Lampert, "but there, bar an island
or so there's nothing to speak of in our way.
And if the skipper will crack on, and it a week
since we saw the sun, it's the owners' look out,
not mine."
</p>

<p>
He spoke with a certain bitterness, as
though he would really enjoy being wrecked,
in the trust that the <i>Potluck</i> was not insured,
and that old Jones would get his certificate
cancelled, or at least suspended.
</p>

<p>
"'Twould give the old ass time to study
foreign politics," sneered Lampert, as it breezed
up again.
</p>

<p>
And five minutes' later, while Lampert was
lighting his pipe half-way down the cabin stairs,
he heard a bellow forward which made him
drop thoughts of tobacco.
</p>

<p>
"Breakers ahead!"
</p>

<p>
The watch came out on deck and ran aft;
and were followed by the watch below in various
articles of attire, not calculated to keep them
very warm.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Potluck</i> had been running with the wind
nearly dead aft.
</p>

<p>
"Starboard, starboard!" roared Lampert.
"Oh, steady; hold her there!"
</p>

<p>
The vessel ran off to port at a sharp angle
to her wake.
</p>

<p>
"Up here some," yelled the mate, "and set
the spanker!  Stand by the&mdash;&mdash;  My God!"
</p>

<p>
And, as old Jones and Simcox came on deck,
the <i>Potluck</i> was hard and fast ashore.  With
one simultaneous crack the three topmasts
went over the side, and as the men and officers
jumped under the shelter of the weather rail,
Lampert and those of the watch who were
with him came tumbling down from the poop.
They reckoned on a boiling sea coming after
and sweeping them away.  But though the
malignity native to matter had set the <i>Potluck</i>
ashore, by good luck she was hard and fast
in the one sheltered cove on the island.  When
Lampert by instinct altered her course to port,
as he heard the coast breakers at the starboard
bow, he had run her in between two ledges
of rock, of which the outer or more westerly
one acted as a complete breakwater.
</p>

<p>
The skipper, who had been lying flat when
the others jumped for the main deck, got up
and crawled forward to the break of the poop.
He was half-paralysed with a mixture of funk
and rage.  He addressed himself and his
remarks to the sky, the sea, and the island,
but above all to Lampert.
</p>

<p>
"You man-drowning, slop-built caricature
of a sailorman, what 'ave you bin and done
with my ship?" he bellowed.  "Oh, Lord,
I'm a ruined man; by gosh, I'll murder you!"
</p>

<p>
He tumbled down on the main deck and
made for Lampert, who easily dodged him.
</p>

<p>
"Shut up, you old idiot!" said the mate
contemptuously.  "Who but me told you that
if you drove her in thick weather, and no sun
seen for a week, you'd pile her up?"
</p>

<p>
Simcox caught Jones and held him.
</p>

<p>
"Good lord, sir," said the second greaser,
"it's no time to fight."
</p>

<p>
"No, it ain't," said Jack Hart boldly.
</p>

<p>
That a foremast hand should dare to shove
his oar in, almost cowed the poor old Guffin.
It was something out of nature.
</p>

<p>
"It ain't no time for jawbation," insisted
Hart, about whom the others had gathered.
"It's time for thinkin' out the politics of the
situation, and if I'm not mistaken we shall
be able to walk ashore by the morning, and
there won't be no ship for any one to
command&mdash;so what's the use of jaw?  I say
get up stores, eh, Mackenzie?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask me," said old Mac.  "I was
thinkin' that mighty soon we'd be able to
settle that question about the buildin' of the <i>Potluck</i>."
</p>

<p>
And as by this time Jones was calming
down and was rather inclined to cry, Lampert
came up to the restive crowd.
</p>

<p>
"You dry up, Hart," he said roughly.
"Until the ship's broken up, you're on the
articles.  Say another word and I'll break your jaw."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Hart respectfully.
</p>

<p>
Until dawn they loafed about the deck and
in the cabin and foc'sle, discussing whether
they were on one of the Crozets or what, and
whether they would stay long there, and if so
what, and so on.
</p>

<p>
And just as the dawn broke over the island
they got an awful surprise.  They saw a man
standing on the low cliff on about a level with
the jagged splinters of the fore-topmast where
it had gone short in the cap.
</p>

<p>
"The bloomin' hisland's in'abited," cried
a foremast hand, and every one rushed
forward to interview the gesticulating stranger.
</p>

<p>
"Wod's the bloke say?" asked the crowd.
"Oh, say it again!"  And the stranger said it
again.
</p>

<p>
But the crowd shook a unanimous head.
</p>

<p>
"I believe the silly galoot don't talk English,"
cried Hart; "'ere, where's Dutchy?"
</p>

<p>
They shoved their one "Dutchman"
forward, and after some interchange of
utter un-intelligibilities, listened to by every
one with bated breath, Hermann turned round.
</p>

<p>
"I not versteh, captain.  I denk him ein
French."
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman was joined by two or three
more, and then by a dozen.
</p>

<p>
"Why, they're all French," said the
disgusted crowd.  "What's Frenchmen doin' on
any island of ours?"
</p>

<p>
And until the sea went down, which it did
sufficiently to allow them to get ashore at about
ten o'clock, they discussed the question as to
whether the Crozets were English or not.  It
was settled by old Mackenzie.
</p>

<p>
"All islands as don't belong to any one
belongs to us," he said; "it was arranged so
by Disraeli."
</p>

<p>
They got ashore with some risk, and were
greeted by the Frenchman in the most amiable
way.
</p>

<p>
"Poor beggars!" said the crew; "it must be
'ard on a soft lot of things like them to be on
a des'late hisland.  Ain't it a wonder Froggies
ever goes to sea?  But does they belong 'ere,
or was they piled hup same's hus?"
</p>

<p>
Hart found himself alongside a Frenchman
with a long red Liberty cap on, and a big pair
of ear-rings in his ears.
</p>

<p>
"Goddam," said the Frenchman.
</p>

<p>
"That's what we say," cried Hart.  "Here,
you chaps, he speaks English."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" said the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"I spike Engelish," nodded the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"How'd you come 'ere?" asked the eager
chorus.
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Goddam!" he said, smiling.  "Ship!
Por'smout'&mdash;London!  I spick En'lish."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," said Hart desperately, "just
dry up with your mixed hogwash, and spit it
all out free as to 'ow you came 'ere, and wot
the name o' this bally rock is, and who's its
in'abitants.  Now, give it lip!"
</p>

<p>
"Hart's a nateral born speaker, and 'as a
clear 'ead," said the crowd.  "'E puts it in a
nutshell, and don't run to waste in words."
</p>

<p>
But the Frenchman looked puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Comb wiz," he said; "spik En'lish
besser," and he pointed over the low rise.
</p>

<p>
"Steady!" said Hart; "boys, I'm not clear
as to whether we hain't bein' led hinto a
hambush.  It hain't nateral for shipwrecked
Englishmen to find Frenchies shipwrecked too!"
</p>

<p>
"It ain't," said the crew suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"And even if it's all right, we bein' strangers
might be led into makin' a treaty without
knowin' all there is to know.  I vote waitin'
till the officers comes up."
</p>

<p>
They squatted down on rocks and on the
lumps of tussac grass till the captain and
the two mates came along with the rest of the
Frenchmen.  Hart communicated his suspicions
to the skipper, who was decidedly under the
influence of alcohol.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said the Guffin thickly.
"<i>We</i> can manage Frenchmen.  They ain't goin'
to make no French Shore question on no more
of our islands.  One Newfoundland's enough
for me.  I'll show you n'gotiations&mdash;'gotiashuns
is my forte!"  And he led the way over the
hill.  Below them they saw the wreck of a
French barquantine.
</p>

<p>
"Blimy," said the crowd, with a frown, "if
they 'aven't got the best part of our hisland!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was not to be endured by any lot of
Englishmen under the sun, that the best part
of this rock should be occupied by their
natural foes, and soon there was evidence that
in any attempt to turn the Frenchmen out the
British leader would have a united nation at
his back.
</p>

<p>
The Guffin and the two mates argued it,
and Lampert was the Opposition.
</p>

<p>
"W'y, wot's this you're sayin'?" asked the
disgusted skipper; "did I think to 'ave shipped
a Verning 'Arcourt among my lot?  You're a
Little Englander, and nothin' but it, Lampert."
</p>

<p>
"They was here first," said Lampert obstinately.
</p>

<p>
"But the hisland is British ground," urged
Simcox, "and where our flag flies no Frenchman
can have the best.  We gives 'em liberty to
trade, and they can take what's left.  What
for have we always beat 'em if we're to give in
now?"
</p>

<p>
"Continuosity of foreign politics is my
motter," said the skipper.  "With continuosity
and joodishus firmness, and a polite 'hout o'
this,' you'll see 'em listen to reason, and
evacuate.  I shall send hin my hultimatum this
very afternoon.  And you, Simcox, shall be
hambassador."
</p>

<p>
Simcox looked anxious.
</p>

<p>
"Well, captain, I was thinking it would
be judicious policy to send in the Dutchman.
It will remind them that Europe is more or
less agin them, and to have a Dutchman here
will make 'em think twice afore they elects for war."
</p>

<p>
The skipper shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No, Simcox, it looks judicious on the
surface, but takin' deeper thought it ain't.  It
would aggerawate them, and that ain't policy.
We fights if we must, but don't start it by doin'
anythin' unpleasin' more'n askin' for our rights.
And in n'gotiashuns it ain't policy to remind
'em deliberate of the time the Prooshians beat
'em.  And moreover it's accordin' to no
tradition I've heard of to send a furriner as
hambassador.  No, Simcox, you shall go.  I'll
draw up the hultimatum at once."
</p>

<p>
He returned on board the wreck of the
<i>Potluck</i>, and in company with a bottle of brandy
strove with the situation, while the crowd and
their spokesman, Hart, argued like a House of Commons.
</p>

<p>
"It ain't any good talkin'," said Jack, "and
hevery one knows that give a Frenchman the
chance of hargument he'll talk a government
mule's 'ind leg off.  'Hout of this,' is the
on'y hargument a Frenchman hunderstands."
</p>

<p>
"But they seems to be a good many more
of 'em than us," suggested the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Come to that," said Hart, "it's the on'y
just ground we 'as to go for 'em.  For if they
was on'y ekal numbers, it'd be cowardly to
whack 'em, and I for one would be on the
side of just goin' down there and shovin' them
out peaceful.  I'm for the hultimatum right
off.  I wonder 'ow the Guffin will put it.  Say,
boys, 'ere 'e comes!"
</p>

<p>
The "old man" staggered up with a sheet
of paper in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Have you done it, sir?" asked Simcox.
"Let's hear it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, read it out," said Lampert, with half
a sneer, which the skipper did not notice.
</p>

<p>
The crowd gathered round as the captain
squatted on a rock.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"On board the British barque <i>Potluck</i>, belonging
to the British port Liverpool; owners, McWattie
&amp; Co.; Captain Abednego Jones.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"MR. SIMCOX,&mdash;Sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Eh, what?" said the astounded Simcox.
</p>

<p>
"It's addressed to you, Simcox," said the
skipper blandly.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Simcox.
</p>

<p>
The skipper shook his head impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you'd 'ave knowed, Simcox.
You're the hambassador, and you've to
communicate this to 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go on, sir," said the crowd.
</p>

<p>
The skipper resumed:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"MR. SIMCOX,&mdash;Sir, you'll be so good as to be
so kind as to communicate the contents of this
'ere letter to them French of the wreck we don't
know the name of, and tell them to clear.  For
there ain't no reasonable grounds for supposin'
this ain't a British hisland (seeing that mostly
all hislands is) and they've by comin' 'ere first
got and taken possession of the best bit of it,
which can't be allowed, as it's contrary to law
in such case made and purvided.  So you'll
inform 'em it ain't goin' to be put up with,
and they must evacuate immejit and resume the
<i>statues quo</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"What's that?" asked Simcox.
</p>

<p>
"It's Latin, you unutterable ass," said the
skipper, with a look of withering contempt.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know Latin," said the poor second mate.
</p>

<p>
"And who expected it of you?" asked the
skipper.  "It means that things are to go
on as they was afore they come:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"&mdash;&mdash;resume the <i>statues quo</i>, and don't stand
no hargument.  You are to tell 'em it will be
considered an unfriendly hact, and that we 'as
cleared for haction in consequence of not
believing them such cowards as to quit.  But quit
they must, and no mistake, or we resort without
delay to the arbitrage and general haverage of
war.  Given this day on board the British barque
<i>Potluck</i> by me,

<p class="letter">
"CAPTAIN ABEDNEGO JONES."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"First rate!" said the crew.  "That'll give
'em the jumps."
</p>

<p>
"And how am I to translate it?" asked
the miserable Simcox.
</p>

<p>
"That's your look-out," said the Guffin, with
a hiccup.  "Shall I keep a dog and bark myself?
Now, 'urry and get it hover.  And let hevery
one 'ave a weapon, 'andspikes and belayin'
pins.  Now go, Simcox!"
</p>

<p>
"Hart, come along with me," said Simcox.
</p>

<p>
And as the "old man" was engaged in keeping
his balance, he made no objection.
</p>

<p>
"I think this is a herror of judgment, sir,"
said Hart; "my hidea of a hultimatum was
jumpin' on 'em unexpected, and givin' 'em
toko afore they know'd where they was.  My
notion of fightin' (and it pays hevery time)
is to haggravate your man till he's ready to
'it, but to 'it 'im fust.  An' if I thinks a
cove will 'it me in five minutes, I lets no
time go by in hanticipatin' 'im.  But this
will warn 'em."
</p>

<p>
"But they have no one who really knows
English, Hart," groaned Simcox; "and I
don't know the first word of French."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, sir," said Hart encouragingly.
"I've 'ad many a row with a Frenchy, and
I never knowed my 'avin' not the least
notion of what 'e meant ever stopped the fight
from comin' off.  If so be I see you get
stuck, I'll come in, sir."
</p>

<p>
And they were met by the French sailor
who thought he spoke English.
</p>

<p>
"I spik En'lish, goddam," said the
Frenchman.  "Leaverpool, Por'smout'; mais le
capitaine spik besser."
</p>

<p>
"Good-mornin'," said Simcox meekly to the
French captain, a long unhappy looking man,
who might have been the skipper of a
<i>chasse-marée</i> for all the style he put on.
</p>

<p>
"Mais, oui&mdash;&mdash;" said the captain.
</p>

<p>
"This 'ere paper is for you," said Simcox,
"and by the powers I hope you can't read it."
</p>

<p>
He handed the ultimatum to the Frenchman,
who studied it while his crew came round.
</p>

<p>
"Je ne peux pas le lire, monsieur," he said
at length.
</p>

<p>
Simcox turned to Hart.
</p>

<p>
"There, now what the blazes am I to do
when he talks that way?"
</p>

<p>
"Just hexplain it," said Hart, as he helped
himself to a chew.  "Say, 'Hout o' this!'"
</p>

<p>
"It means you've got to go," said Simcox;
"you can't be allowed to stay in the best part
of our island."
</p>

<p>
"Goddam," cried the Frenchman, with his
hand in his hair.  "I spik English, two, tree
word: pilote, feesh, shannel, owaryo!"
</p>

<p>
"Owaryo?" asked Simcox.
</p>

<p>
"That's his way o' sayin' 'How are you?'"
interjected Hart, who was contemptuously
sizing up the French sailors.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, how are you?" said Simcox.
</p>

<p>
"Owaryo," replied the French captain, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, thanks," said Simcox; "but
I'm the ambassador."
</p>

<p>
"Ma foi, ambassadeur!  You spik Français?"
</p>

<p>
"And you've just got to get," added Simcox.
</p>

<p>
"March!" cried Hart.
</p>

<p>
The Frenchmen "jabbered" a bit among
themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Quoi donc?  Marcher?" asked their skipper.
</p>

<p>
"We, old son," said Hart; "marshay if you
like.  Just pack up and quit.  We gives you
an hour to gather up your dunnage.  Now do
you understand?"
</p>

<p>
Whether the Frenchmen understood or not
it was tolerably obvious they did not like the
tone with which Hart spoke, or the looks of
evident disfavour he cast at them.  The
captain turned away.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" said Hart, and he went in for a
dumb pantomime, in which he vaguely
suggested that over yonder hill was an army of
Englishmen.
</p>

<p>
"And we mean 'avin' our rights," he ended
with.  And just then old Jones appeared in
sight.
</p>

<p>
"Are they jossers goin' to evacuate or not?"
he bellowed.  "What's their captain say to the
<i>statues quo</i>?  Don't they know the first thing
about diplomatics?  Tell 'em that to prepare
for peace we makes war."
</p>

<p>
"War it is," said Hart, and he launched
himself at a crowd of Frenchmen, as his mates
came tumbling down the hill.
</p>

<p>
The fight was short, sharp, and pretty
decisive, for the <i>Potluck's</i> crowd numbered
ten able seamen, one ordinary seaman, and two
boys, or with the captain and the two mates,
sixteen in all.  Against this array there were
twenty-one Frenchmen, and though Hart, in
his first onslaught, knocked down two, he was
himself stretched out by a third armed with a
broken hand-spike.  And Simcox fled with the
infuriated foreigners at his heels.  The true
battle (for this was but an affair of outposts)
joined on the crest of the rise, and in five
minutes the English were in flight for the
shelter of the piled-up <i>Potluck</i>.  Old Jones was
keeled over once, but Lampert and Mackenzie
dragged him away and got him down to the
ship.  He swore most terribly.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere's a pretty kettle o' fish," said he at
last; "a pretty lot I 'as to my back to let a few
Frenchies lick 'em this way.  What's the good
o' diplomatics if my men 'asn't the guts to
support me?  Where's that Simcox?"
</p>

<p>
"Here, sir," said the ambassador.
</p>

<p>
"Who told you to start a row?" demanded
the skipper.  "Don't you know your duty?
You was to give 'em the hultimatum and retire
dignified.  Do you call it retirin' dignified to
run and beller like a bull-calf?"
</p>

<p>
Simcox looked sulky and injured.
</p>

<p>
"How was I to look dignified with six of
'em after me&mdash;and two with knives and one
with a meat-chopper?" he asked.  "And
as for startin' a rough house, 'twas Hart as
done it."
</p>

<p>
"Where's Hart?" yelled the Guffin.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere, 'Art, where are you?" said the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"I believe he's a prisoner," said Lampert.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lord," said the crowd, "but Jack
never 'ad no discretion."
</p>

<p>
"We must 'ave him liberated," said the
skipper firmly.  "No man of mine must be in
the 'ands of them mutilatin' French.  Simcox,
you'll 'ave to go to 'em again and open
n'gotiashuns!"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," said Simcox, "if you'll excuse
me, I'll do nothin' of the sort.  I've had my
fill up of bein' ambassador."
</p>

<p>
"This is mut'ny," said the skipper; "but
under the painful national circumstances I
shan't do nothin' but order you to your cabin,
where you'll consider yourself in custody."
</p>

<p>
Simcox looked greatly relieved, and went
without delay.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Lampert, you'll be hambassador," said
the old man, after a drink of brandy.
</p>

<p>
The mate looked the skipper up and down.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see you further first," he cried.
"'Twas you that started the row and the
trouble, and you can get out of it as you like."
</p>

<p>
"This is rank mut'ny," said the skipper,
"and you could be 'ung for refusin' duty.
But under the painful nash'nal circumstances
you can retire to your cabin and be your
own bloomin' policeman till peace is restored,
when I'll try you and sentence you, you run
and scuttle swine you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's all right," said the mate contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"Now, men," said the skipper thickly, "what
I wants is 'earty support.  Who'll volunteer
for to be hambassador?"
</p>

<p>
The crew looked at each other and shook
their heads.  They scuffled with uneasy feet
on the lopsided deck.
</p>

<p>
"They're standin' upon the 'ill as thick
as pea-sticks," said one of the boys.
</p>

<p>
"Speak hup," roared the skipper.
</p>

<p>
The crew shoved old Mac in front.
</p>

<p>
"We've revolved the notion up and over,"
said Mac, "and we've come to the conclusion,
sir, there ain't nothin' to be got by sendin'
ignorant men like we on such errands."
</p>

<p>
The skipper hiccupped angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Who asted you to think?  But I ain't the
man to press unwilling lubbers into goin' aloft,
<i>I</i> can lead the way.  Go into the fo'castle, you
dogs, and consider yourselves under arrest.  Go!"
</p>

<p>
"Blimy," said the crowd, "but we're all in
our own custody, so we are.  Now what's the
old man goin' to do?"
</p>

<p>
They watched him from the fo'castle as he
staggered into his own part of the ship.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be my own hambassador," said Jones.
"I'll show 'em 'ow to work things with
dignity; I'll show that ass Lampert what's
o'clock.  What you wants in such cases made
and provided is tact, and go, and innerds.
Innerds is the chief need.  Why fight if
palaver'll do?  Where I was wrong was to
send a galoot like Simcox.  But what could I
do but work the best with the tools I 'ad?
If I'd gone myself, we'd 'ave made peace afore
there was a row."
</p>

<p>
He came staggering out of the cabin with a
case of brandy and laid it on the after capstan.
</p>

<p>
"I guess I'll have a boy," said Jones.  "'Ere,
you scum, send me Billy."  And Billy came aft.
</p>

<p>
"I releases you temp'ry without bail," said
the skipper fiercely, "so puckalow that case and
foller me.  No, you wait till I gets a tablecloth
as a signal I'm willin' to 'ave peace."
</p>

<p>
When he came out with a cloth he went
ashore and stumbled up the hill, followed by
the boy Billy, bearing the case of brandy.  He
found the crew of the Frenchmen lining the
crest, and heard them talk.
</p>

<p>
"Say, Johnny French," said old Jones, "if
you wants war, prepare for peace.  Who's
the captain?"
</p>

<p>
"Sapristi!" said the French captain.
</p>

<p>
Jones nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Give it up, old son.  It warn't my fault,
if relyin' on the discretion of ambassadors ain't
a fault: and maybe you can swaller the
hultimatum with some real good brandy
throwed in.  And is your name Sapristi?"
</p>

<p>
"Nom de Dieu&mdash;&mdash;" began the Frenchman,
but Jones waved his hand with dignity.
</p>

<p>
"Call yourself what you like, but 'ave you
got anythin' in the way of a marlinspike or
a splice bar as'll open this yer case?"
</p>

<p>
The foreigners, perceiving that the Englishman
was on an errand of peace, gathered about the
case, and soon discovered from the stencilled
inscription that it at any rate pretended to
come from Cognac.
</p>

<p>
"Goddam," said the little red-capped
Frenchman who had first discovered them.
"Cognac!  I spik English&mdash;brandee,
Por'smout', Lon-don!"
</p>

<p>
Jones made signs that he presented the case
to them.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't above makin' a concession or two,"
he remarked confidentially to the French
captain; "but if I'd listened to my lot on
board, it would 'ave been blood up to the neck."
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"You bet it would 'ave bin," said Jones
earnestly, "but what d'ye say to 'avin' a drink?
Billy, gimme your knife."
</p>

<p>
And with it he started opening the case,
while the Frenchmen's eyes gleamed in pleasing
anticipation.  They had not had a drink for
weeks.  And as they carried the case down
to the ship with Jones and their own captain
in the rear, they concluded that the English
were not such bad chaps after all.
</p>

<p>
"But where's my man 'Art!" asked Jones,
when he came to the French camp.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere I be," cried Hart, who was lashed
hard and fast to a round rock.  "Lord,
captain, but I've 'ad a time.  Can't you cut
me adrift, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Jones shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"You interferin' galoot, it serves you right.
And as for that, the 'ole crew's under arrest,
where I put 'em for mut'ny, and I don't see
as I should so pick and choose among 'em as
to use my hinfluence to 'ave you let go.
At any rate, bide a bit, and I'll see."
</p>

<p>
For it was obvious that the drinking was
going to begin.  The French captain served
the liquor out in a small glass to every one,
and presently some of his melancholy
disappeared.  He gave an order to one of his men
who brought two more glasses, one for the
English captain, and one for himself.
</p>

<p>
"I looks towards you," said Jones.
</p>

<p>
"À votre santé," cried the Frenchman.
"Monsieur, vous êtes un homme de coeur
quand mêne."
</p>

<p>
"I don't savvy, but I dessay you means
well," said the captain.  "Now, if I'd thought
to bring along the signal book we might 'ave
'ad quite a talk.  But time enough; I dessay
afore we're took off I shall patter your lingo
like blazes.  Shall I cut my man loose there?"
</p>

<p>
He pointed to Hart, and though two of the
Frenchmen, who had black eyes, remonstrated
against the deed of mercy, Hart was unlashed
and given a drink.
</p>

<p>
"Here's to you, old cocklywax," said Hart,
with a scrape of his leg.  "I bears no grudge,
not me."
</p>

<p>
And very soon the French and English
skippers were talking to each other at the rate of
knots, while Hart sat in a crowd of Frenchmen
and told them all about everything.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was close on sundown when Jones returned
to the <i>Potluck</i>.  He had to be helped up the
side by some of the crew.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't we under arrest?" they asked.
"Does we dare come out?"
</p>

<p>
Jones hiccupped.
</p>

<p>
"I releases you on your own recognition,"
he said.  "So down you come and 'elp."
</p>

<p>
When he put his foot on the deck, he
mustered all hands aft.
</p>

<p>
"And you, Lampert, and you, Simcox!"
</p>

<p>
The two mates came out of their cabins.
</p>

<p>
"And where's Hart?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please, sir, he's drunk," said Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Arrest 'im," said the skipper; "what's 'e
mean by it?  Now, look 'ere, you bally lot,
what does you think of yourselves?"
</p>

<p>
The crew appeared uneasy.
</p>

<p>
"I went all by my lone," said the skipper,
hanging on to the poop ladder, "all by my
lone I went, and I brings back peace!  Do you
'ear?  But when I sent you, what use was
you?  I released 'Art, who's repaid me by
bein' unable to see an 'ole in a ladder; and
I've concluded a treaty of peace and friendship
with the French.  Next time (if so be a German
ship comes ashore) I'll go out as my own
hambassador.  No, Simcox, never more!  No,
Lampert, never, never more!  I just speaks to
that French crowd, and they are civil and drink
fair.  They recognised they'd met their match.
Their skipper says, says he, 'Captain Jones, I
owns fair and square I'm not your ekal at
diplomatics.'  He adds, moreover, 'Captain
Jones, damn me if I believe your match is to be
found.'  And I says, with dignity (with dignity,
Simcox), 'Right you are!'  That's what I says.
And as for you, you ratty galoots, you'll treat
'em when you meets 'em just the same as if
they wasn't French.  Do you 'ear me?  That's
my hultimatum.  Now you can go.  That'll do the watch."
</p>

<p>
He turned to the mates.
</p>

<p>
"I thought better of you two, so I did," he
remarked sadly.  "But there, you 'aven't 'ad
my experience, and when I gets 'ome I shall
see as them that is in power at the Furrin
Office 'ears 'ow I done it.  Salisbury ain't my
stiffness of backbone, and 'e ain't my tact.  If
so be as 'e was to invite them Frenchmen to
dinner, it would be different.  They knows (as the
French captain owned to me; fair and square
'e owned it) they don't 'ave no nat'ral right to
hislands and col'nies.  Make the Frenchmen's
'omes 'appy and they'll stay at 'ome.  Think
it hout; you'll see 'ow it could be done.  There
now, that'll do you.  I disarrest you!"
</p>

<p>
And the "old man" rolled cheerfully for his
cabin.
</p>

<p>
"By my lone I done it!" said the Guffin.
</p>

<h3>
THE CREW OF THE <i>KAMMA FUNDER</i>.
</h3>

<p>
The stars of European science, who had
been shining in a wonderful constellation
over Quebec, were just about to leave Canada
in that well-known comfortable liner, the <i>Nipigon</i>,
when a most annoying thing happened.  The
cattle-ship <i>Abbitibbe</i>, never famous at any time
for minding her helm, got her steam steering
gear jammed as she was passing the <i>Nipigon</i>,
and took a wide sheer to port when she should
have altered her course to starboard.  The
peaceful preparations of the passenger boat
were broken up, and her crew received the
wild charge of the <i>Abbitibbe</i> with curses, which,
though effectual in heating the atmosphere,
were no use as a fender.  The <i>Nipigon</i> was
cut down to the water's edge, and the scientific
lights of Europe were much put out.  They
hurried ashore in the most irregular and
unscientific manner, and, having sent others for
their baggage, began to make preparations
for going to New York, as no other good
passenger boat was leaving the St. Lawrence for
a week.
</p>

<p>
But Nature, possibly out of revenge for the
unseemly curiosity evinced by all men of science,
was beforehand with them.  Misfortunes, as was
once observed by an intelligent, if pessimistic,
anthropoid ape, never come singly.  It was the
twelfth of November, and a sudden blizzard,
bringing all the snow it could carry, broke up
communication with the south.  If the men
of science were to keep their appointments with
their universities, it was necessary to sail from
Canada at once.  They shipped themselves
under protest upon the <i>Nemagosenda</i>, of 2,900
tons register, which was little better than a
tramp, and was commanded by Captain Joseph
Prowse.
</p>

<p>
"Immortal Jehoshaphat!" said Captain
Prowse; "here's a go!  What, we with
passengers?  Oh, get out!"
</p>

<p>
"You've got to take 'em," said the agent
philosophically; "maybe they'll teach you
something, and it'll be a good advertisement."
</p>

<p>
"Gah'n!" said Prowse; "carryin' scientific
jossers won't bring better freight next season.
I wish you'd get me chock up with cattle.  I
can't stand scientists; my sister married one
that was an 'erbalist in the Old Kent Road&mdash;and
since he went to chokey I've lost conceit with
science.  However, if it must be&mdash;why, send
'em along!"
</p>

<p>
Captain Prowse was not a popular skipper
with sailors.  They said that he was a "hard
nut" and a "sailor-robber," and that his
American experience had made him nearly as
deadly as any American captain with a belaying-pin.
But sailors' experience only works backward:
they are good at reminiscence only, and
the <i>Nemagosenda</i> got a crew in spite of the
captain's reputation.  It is possible they would
not have shipped if they had known that men
of European light and leading were to come
with them.  Those who follow the sea have a
great respect for knowledge, but they despise
men in soft hats and spectacles.  And it cannot
be denied that scientific men are as a rule too
simple and gentle to look as if they could take
care of themselves.  According to Jack, that
is the first duty of man, though he premises
naturally that even the toughest courage and
the greatest skill may come to grief about
women.
</p>

<p>
"A thunderin' measly lot," said Simpkins
A.B. to his particular mate, when the scientific
passengers came on board; "why, they've all
soft 'ats but one!  And long beards!  And
three out of four with specs!  Holy sailor,
what a gang!"
</p>

<p>
Harris nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Why, there's twenty of 'em, Bill, but I'll
bet a plug of the best to an old chew that
me and you goin' for 'em with belayin'-pins
could do up the 'ole crowd in five minutes."
</p>

<p>
"You've sized 'em up," said Simpkins, with
a sneer, and then the captain roared.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye, sir," said the mate.  "Let
go!  All gone, sir!  Now then, haul in."  And
the <i>Nemagosenda</i> went out into the
stream.
</p>

<p>
It took some three days or so for the men of
science to settle down.  For during the first
few days the pathology of sea-sickness occupied
all their attention; they had no time for other
things.  But when their last all-night session
was over, and they were seen again upon deck,
the affairs of the <i>Nemagosenda</i> became interesting.
The mate and the port watch developed
long-threatened divergencies, and Captain Prowse
came to the assistance of his chief officer with
a brass belaying-pin.  As the result of this
the pathologist indulged in a little practical
surgery, and a division arose in the scientific
ranks.  The political economist argued with
the statistician.
</p>

<p>
"Statistics prove that the common sailor
must be treated with sternness," said the
authority in figures, "and it is our duty to
support authority."
</p>

<p>
"The captain is a brute," said the political
economist, "and for two pins I would tell
him so.  You cannot neglect the human
factor&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Says political economy," sneered the
statistician.
</p>

<p>
And then the geologist, who was a man of
sense, said they were both talking rot.  The
discussion on the poop was broken up by the
captain, who came on deck with a face like
the north-west moon in a fog.  Having
demanded the presence of the crew aft, he gave
them an address on their duties to their
superiors.
</p>

<p>
"You think yourselves a fine lot of chaps,"
said the captain fiercely, "but my opinion of
you is that you are a scaly crowd of wharf-rats,
and all your relations of both sexes are no
better than they should be.  So look here, you
swine, I'll have you know I'm Captain Joseph
Prowse, and the man that gives any slack jaw
to any officer of mine gives it to me.  And
the man that gives it to me will wish he was
dead before he sees Liverpool.  That's me.
I'm Captain Joseph Prowse, so I am, and any
crew under me has got to know it.  I'm king
here, and I'll wade in blood before I get off my
throne.  Mr. Watts, put this crawling lot to
holy stoning the deck!"
</p>

<p>
And Captain Joseph Prowse rejoined his
scientific passengers.
</p>

<p>
"All crews is the same, gentlemen," he said
thickly; "there's something deep and dark in
the nature of things as makes 'em so.  Those
that do the rough work on board ships are just
so necessarily, and if I was to ship a crew of
angels, though they might be handy for going
aloft, they'd turn devils by the time they'd ate
a pound of beef and biscuit."
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever tried kindness and persuasion?"
asked the meteorologist.
</p>

<p>
The captain looked him up and down.
</p>

<p>
"Ever tried it!" he ejaculated scornfully;
"'ave I ever tried anything else?  It's kindness
to sailormen to let 'em know who's boss.  Spare
the belayin'-pin and the 'andspike and you'll
spoil the sailor.  Oh, Solomon know'd his
business when he used them words.  He didn't
sail to Ophir for nothin'."
</p>

<p>
"But, Captain Prowse," said the meek
gentleman, whose great subject was cannibalism,
"isn't it very unpleasant work rubbing the decks
with stones this cold weather?"
</p>

<p>
"Unpleasant!" said the skipper, "and what
do you think?  Was I proposin' to reward 'em?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose not," said the ethnologist, "but
I'm sure it's awful work.  I could never do it."
</p>

<p>
Captain Prowse snorted.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, you could, if you was in my crew,"
he remarked.  "If one of you gents was
captain, you'd find this crowd couldn't do
nothing but sit in the foc'sle and drink 'ot
coffee.  It's all accordin' where you are, and
what kind of a man's on top."
</p>

<p>
"In other words, circumstance creates
character," said the statistician.
</p>

<p>
"That's a ridiculous exaggeration," said the
authority on heredity.  "A man is what he is
born."
</p>

<p>
Captain Joseph Prowse laughed scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"Not he&mdash;he's what I makes of him, and if
you gents was under me I'd make you sailors
long afore you suspected it.  By the way, could
you tell me what branch of science an 'erbalist
belongs to?"
</p>

<p>
And the conversation followed more pleasant lines.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Nemagosenda</i>, although little better than
a tramp in her appearance, could do her ten
knots an hour on less than twenty tons of coal
a day, and she soon got out to the Banks,
where the men of science discussed fishing, and
the colour of sea-water, and icebergs.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the geologist, "an iceberg swims
on an average seven-eighths below and an
eighth above."
</p>

<p>
"Gammon!" said Captain Prowse rudely;
"why, any sailor knows better.  I'm surprised
at a scientific josser like you bein' so ignorant.
It's one-third above and two below.  You ask
my mate if it isn't so."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, thanks, I will," said the geologist
pleasantly.  "Mr. Watts is a well-informed man?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather," said Prowse, nodding; "there's not
a den o' thieves in any port in Europe he can't
find blindfold.  And 'e knows more about
icebergs than me, for he once went a trip in
a Dundee whaler.  He ain't proud of it, and
don't talk of it much, for whalers is no class,
as you may guess.  But he's keen on knowledge,
is Watts, I'll say that for him.  You might
do worse than ask him for some ackerate
information.  He's a perfect whale on fogs, too!"
</p>

<p>
If Mr. Watts was the authority on fogs
that his captain made out, he soon had an
opportunity of showing it, for half-way across
the Banks it was impossible to see farther than
one could throw half a hundredweight, and the
<i>Nemagosenda</i> went tooting in darkness.  But
every now and again in this dim world the
men of science were alarmed and entertained
by sudden battles in blasphemy between Captain
Prowse, or the well-informed Mr. Watts,
and the crew of a Bank fisherman.  For fog
blankets sound in the oddest, most erratic way,
and the throb of a screw cannot always be heard
even in the calmest foggy weather.  Such
swearing matches between the <i>Nemagosenda</i>
and a smack were, when apparently good for
three minutes or so, sometimes sliced right
in two by the sudden dropping down of what
the meteorologist called an "anacoustic" wall of
fog.  Like the last words of Don Whiskerandos
in <i>A Tragedy Rehearsed</i>, a speech was cut off
in the very flower of its youth.
</p>

<p>
"Where the blue blinding blazes are you
coming to?" asked a faint nocturne.  And
when Captain Prowse had expended his last
carefully prepared oration, the right of maritime
reply only conferred an audible "Oh, you
dog&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We have to thank the anacoustic properties
of that fog-bank for the sudden conclusion,"
said the meteorologist, "for if I'm any judge
of human nature, that smacksman is still firing
red-hot words into space."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Prowse indignantly,
"they're a foul-mouthed lot.  It's as much as
I can do to keep even with 'em.  But I'll
slow down no more."
</p>

<p>
He telegraphed "Full speed ahead" and
left Mr. Watts with awfully worded instructions
to sink anything, from a battleship to the
meanest brig afloat.  In the saloon he sat at
the head of the table, and drank rum hot.
</p>

<p>
"Science proves that rum 'ot is the sailor's
drink," said Captain Prowse, "and the correct
drink.  For we all drink it, and flourish on it.
And the reason is that it goes by contraries.
It's cold work bein' at sea, and so we takes it
'ot; and the sea is salt, so we takes it sweet:
and it comes from the West Indies."
</p>

<p>
"And that proves it," said the geologist
warmly.  "What a head you have, Captain
Prowse!"
</p>

<p>
The skipper nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You may well say so," he affirmed; "a
phrenologist gave me a chart of my 'ead once,
a scientific chart with the soundings wrote out
plain, and what proved him right was his sayin'
that 'ere and there I was too deep for him.
And I paid him a guinea.  Well worth it, it
was, for he said, 'You get married,' and I done
so, and Mrs. Prowse hasn't her living equal.
I wish I'd brought that chart with me.  It
would 'ave interested you gents to know what
a brother scientist thought of me."
</p>

<p>
"It would indeed," said the pathologist.
</p>

<p>
"But there, I'll tell you what I am," said
Prowse, "I'm a down-righter, that's me.  I'm
captain of my boat, I am, and if I was afloat
on a hencoop with all its crew I'd like to see
the cock as would crow before I gave him
orders.  Authority comes nat'ral to me.  I'll be
boss wherever I am&mdash;(Hancocks, more rum!)&mdash;and
I would have succeeded in whatsoever I
took hold of.  Phrenology told me so, wrote
out plain.  And I've a kind of leanin' towards
science ever since that phrenologist put 'is
'and on my 'ead and said with a start of surprise,
'Captain, you're a wonder.'  But I've always
wondered what it was made scientific chaps
look so 'elpless.&mdash;(Hancocks, more rum.)&mdash;But
don't you fret, gents; I'm Captain Joseph
Prowse, and I'll put you safe ashore, or die
in the attempt."
</p>

<p>
And as he again ejaculated "Hancocks, more
rum," he fell asleep upon the table.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," said the geologist, "as our
interests are now secure, I vote we go to bed."
</p>

<p>
But it was still a heavy fog, and the
<i>Nemagosenda</i> was doing her ten knots an hour.
Other steamers were doing the same, or even
more.  Some twenty-knot liners slowed down
(in order that they might say that they had
slowed down) to about nineteen knots and
a half; and some, acting on the theory that
the sooner they went through the fog-belt, the
better for every one, gave their engines all the
steam they could make, and stepped out for
America or England at the pace of an indolent
torpedo-boat.  And the result of this was that
at about four bells in the middle watch, when
the mate's aching eyes could see forty imaginary
steamers where there were none, he omitted
to observe that there was a real one coming
for him till it was too late.  The <i>Nemagosenda</i>
uttered one long horrid wail, which was
answered in vain, and the next minute the
men of science were shot out of their bunks,
and their steamer was taking in the Atlantic
through a hole about the size of a dock gate.
</p>

<p>
What became of the lucky, or unlucky, boat,
which got her blow in first, the crew of the
sinking steamer did not inquire.  They heard
her toot in the distance, and in answer they
blew their whistle for help.  But though a
whistle in a fog may be evidence of good faith,
it is not necessarily for wide publication, and
it is quite possible that the stranger, if she did
not sink, lost her bearings in the fog, and went
off in the wrong direction.  At any rate the
crew and passengers of the <i>Nemagosenda</i> found
themselves adrift in three boats, and in less
than a quarter of an hour they heard, though
they could not see, their steamer blow her deck
out and disappear.
</p>

<p>
"All up with the <i>Goose-ender</i>," said the crew
sulkily, "and now of course it will blow."
</p>

<p>
As ill-luck and hurry would have it, in the
last rush for life most of the crew had tumbled
into the mate's and second mate's boats.  With
the lights of science were the captain and
Simpkins, A.B.
</p>

<p>
"Immortal Jehoshaphat!" said Mr. Joseph
Prowse, "this is a pretty state of affairs.  That
man-drowning swine of a liner!  I 'ope she's
gone down!  I hope the codfish are sizing
her captain up, and sayin' what they think of
him.  Simpkins, keep holloaing!  Where's
them other boats?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't holler no more, sir," whispered
Simpkins hoarsely, "my throat's give out."
</p>

<p>
And as the wind rose the three boats drifted
apart.  Four eminent scientific persons at the
oars kept their boat head on to sea, and six
other eminent persons lay on the bottom boards
and wished they were dead, until the dawn
crawled into the east and showed them that
they were alone.
</p>

<p>
It was a chill and watery dawn, and as the
boat topped the cold green waves on the edge
of the Bank the prospect was eminently unkind.
The wind was not heavy, but it blew hard
enough to bring the spray of each curling wave
inboard, and every one was soaked to the skin.
The sky was lowering and overcast, and though
the fog was dissipated, a mist covered the sun
till it looked, as Simpkins remarked, about as
warm as a new tin plate.
</p>

<p>
It must be said for Captain Joseph Prowse
that he retained in some measure those
characteristics of authority which he claimed for
himself, and by a forced optimism, which the
nature of his crew made him adopt, he
endeavoured to cheer them up.
</p>

<p>
"My luck's temporary out," he declared,
with some show of cheerfulness, "but it ain't
the first time I've been run down, and with
God's 'elp, gents, it won't be the last.  And
it's clean against the nature of things for so
many learn'd men to come to grief at one fell
blow.  'Ere or there a scientific josser may
come to grief in a crowd, but so many bein'
together is the best of insurances.  I'll pull
you through; you mind me.  All I ask you
to remember is that I'm captain, and what I
says goes now and always."
</p>

<p>
"It's all very well," said the meteorologist,
whose temper was going with the skin of his
hands, "but we all thought you had no right
to run so fast in a fog."
</p>

<p>
Captain Prowse gasped, and then recovered
himself.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I tell you I was captain here, same
as on the steamer?"
</p>

<p>
"You did," said the sulky man of science.
</p>

<p>
"Then hold your jaw," said Captain Prowse;
"when you, or the likes of you, is asked for
criticism, it'll be time for you to give it.  Till
then you'll give your captain no lectures on
the running of his vessel.  God and the
Queen's enemies 'as sunk my ship, but neither
one nor the other has took away my natural
gift of authority, so shut up!"
</p>

<p>
And though the meteorologist choked with
rage, he said no more.  Simpkins and the
captain consulted.
</p>

<p>
"We're right in the track of steamers more
or less," said Captain Prowse, "and it bein'
so damp we can hang out without much
drink for a day or so.  And biscuit we 'ave
plenty."
</p>

<p>
Simpkins nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, but this 'ere's a sulky useless
lot, sir."
</p>

<p>
"So they are," said Prowse, "but they'll
'ave to shape themselves as I bid 'em.  The
first crooked word and there'll be a man of
science missing out of this bright gal-acksy
of talent.  I don't care where I am, but there
I'll be captain.  I don't care if they was my
owners, I'd run 'em all the same.  They ain't
passengers no more, they're my crew."
</p>

<p>
He took a drink out of a flask and sank
back in the stern-sheets.
</p>

<p>
"I want you men to keep your eyes
skinned," he said presently.  "Which of you
is the astronomer?"
</p>

<p>
"I am," answered the bow oar, who was a
long, thin man, in a wideawake and spectacles.
</p>

<p>
"Then keep a bright look-out or you'll see
stars," said Prowse.  "And while I'm on it,
I want you jossers to know that you ain't
passengers no more, but a boat's crew, and
my boat's crew, and you'll have to look lively
when I sing out.  So the sooner we get a bit
farther south the better it will be.  That will do."
</p>

<p>
And muttering that he meant being captain
whether he was on an ice-floe or a mud-barge,
he fell asleep and snored.
</p>

<p>
"This brute is coming out in his true
colours," said the astronomer.  "What did
he mean by saying I should see stars?"
</p>

<p>
"Begging your pardon, sir," said Simpkins,
"he meant he'd plug you."
</p>

<p>
"Plug me?"
</p>

<p>
"Bung your eye up," explained Simpkins,
"and Lor' bless you, he'd do it.  Oh, a rare
chap is the captain; why, some years half his
money goes in fines."
</p>

<p>
"I wish to heaven I was ashore," said the
poor astronomer, "and when I get there I'll
see he never gets another job."
</p>

<p>
Simpkins eyed the sleeping skipper in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Best not let him 'ear you, matey," he
cried.  "He'd haze you to death."
</p>

<p>
"Haze me?"
</p>

<p>
"Work you up," explained the seaman.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?"
</p>

<p>
"And I thot you was all learn'd!" said
Simpkins, with great contempt.  "I mean he'd
just sock it to you till you was fair broke up."
</p>

<p>
The day passed without any incident of
vital importance.  It is true they sighted the
smoke of a steamer hull down on the southern
horizon, but they saw nothing else across the
waste of heaving water.  Every now and again
the captain woke up and made a few remarks
on the nature of authority, and what he
proposed doing to those who did not "knuckle
under."  But the night fell without any signs of
mutiny on the part of the scientific crew.
</p>

<p>
In the very early dawn the astronomer,
who had slept in uneasy snatches, woke up
for the tenth time and changed his position.
Simpkins and the geologist were keeping the
boat before the sea, which was running south-east,
and they were both half-blind with fatigue.
</p>

<p>
"I believe I see something out there," said
the astronomer feebly.
</p>

<p>
"You are always seein' suthin'," said Simpkins
crossly, but as he spoke he looked round
and almost dropped his oar.
</p>

<p>
"Wake up, captain!" he shouted.  "Here's
a barque almost so near we could touch her."
</p>

<p>
The skipper roused up, and with him the
rest.  They jumped to their feet.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, sit down, you gang of idiots,"
said the captain; "d'ye want to capsize us?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we are saved, we are saved!" said
the ethnologist, for within half a mile of
them a vessel lay with her main-topsail aback.
There was nothing odd about her to the uneducated
eye, but the skipper looked at Simpkins,
and Simpkins looked at the skipper.
</p>

<p>
"Derelict," said both.
</p>

<p>
For with such a light breeze it was absurd
to see a barque with nothing set but a close
reefed main-topsail, and a fore-topmast staysail
hanging in hanks like a wet duster.
</p>

<p>
"She has seen us," said the geologist.
</p>

<p>
"Seen your grandmother," said the skipper
rudely.  "There ain't a soul aboard her, and
she's water-logged and loaded with lumber
out of Halifax, and she's a northerner, and
about six hundred tons register.  Get the
oars out.  If her decks are awash, she'll be
better than this boat."
</p>

<p>
By the time they came within a cable's
length of her, it was broad daylight, and the
least maritime member of any European scientific
society was able to form an opinion as to
her being derelict.  As she rolled, the water
came out of her scuppers, for her main-deck
was almost level with the sea.  Part of the
gear was let go, and most of the yards were
chafing through their parrals, the main-top-gallant
yard, indeed, was only hanging by the tie
and the lifts, and came crash against the mast
every time the sea lifted the vessel's bows.
Half the bulwarks were gone, and the remains
of the displaced deck cargo showed through
the gaps.  As they got up to her she went
right aback and came round slowly on her heel.
</p>

<p>
"Row up close, sir," said Simpkins, "and
I'll jump."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Captain Prowse, "not with this
lot.  I wouldn't go near her with a crew of
misfits like these, not for money.  We'll go
a bit closer, and you must swim."
</p>

<p>
And in ten minutes Simpkins was on board.
He threw the end of a vang across the boat,
and they brought her astern.
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven," said the men of science
as they trod the slippery decks of the <i>Kamma
Funder</i>, belonging to Copenhagen.
</p>

<p>
But their troubles were only just beginning.
</p>

<p>
The skipper walked aft on the slippery
deck, and climbed upon the poop by way of
the rail, for some of the loose lumber had
dislodged and smashed the poop ladder.  When
he found his foot upon his native heath, he
was once more Captain Joseph Prowse in all his
glory; and turning about, he addressed his crew.
</p>

<p>
"Simpkins," he said, "you are chief officer,
second officer and bo'son, and don't you forget
it.  As for you others, I'll have you know
that you're the crew.  Just drop any kind
of heightened notion that you are passengers,
and we'll get along easy; but if you don't,
look out for squalls.  Simpkins, turn this
useless lot to throwin' the remains of the
deck cargo overboard, and try a couple of 'em
at the pumps; maybe her seams may have
closed up again by now."  And going aft to
the scuttle, he disappeared from view.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the geologist, "of all the
infernal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, stow that," cried Simpkins, "and turn
to.  You're here, ain't you, and lucky you should
consider yourself.  And the captain's a man
of his word, as I know; so look slippy and
pass this bloomin' truck over the side."
</p>

<p>
The miserable crew looked at each other
in despair.
</p>

<p>
"Come now," said Simpkins impatiently,
"do you want me to report you chaps as
refusin' duty?"
</p>

<p>
The geologist, who was the youngest and
sturdiest man in the crowd, said that he did;
but the astronomer and the entomologist
remonstrated with him.
</p>

<p>
"I think we'd better," said the unhappy
insect man.  "This Prowse seems a regular
brute."
</p>

<p>
"He is," said the astronomer, "and I pray to
Heaven that he doesn't find any rum on board."
</p>

<p>
But Heaven did not listen, and the captain
presently came on deck with a flushed face.
</p>

<p>
"Simpkins," roared Prowse, as his head
appeared over the edge of the scuttle.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the new mate.
</p>

<p>
"Is that lumber over the side yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Quick, for Gawd's sake," said Simpkins, and
the reluctant men of science commenced sliding
the boards over.
</p>

<p>
"It's going, sir," answered Simpkins.
</p>

<p>
"Goin'!" said Prowse, when he got his hands
on the after poop rail.  "Goin'!  I should say
so!  What a crowd!  Oh, you miserable things,
I'll shape you; I'll get you into condition; I'll
make sailors of you.  Get two of these hoosiers
on to the pumps and see if she's leakin' very
bad, and then we'll make sail.  This 'ere <i>Kamma
Funder</i> won't make a quick passage, but by
the time we're picked up, or sail 'er 'ome, I'll
make you chaps fit to ship in the worst Cape
Horner that ever sailed."
</p>

<p>
He turned away, but stopped.
</p>

<p>
"And when the deck's clear, Simpkins, you
can let 'em eat what they can get.  There's
plenty of biscuit, but mighty little else.  Now
then, you Stars, pump!"
</p>

<p>
And the astronomer and entomologist pumped
for their lives, while the sea round about
the waterlogged barque was whitening rapidly
with many thousand feet of Nova Scotian
lumber.  For when the captain was out of
sight, Simpkins was encouraging, and talked
what he told them was "horse" sense.
</p>

<p>
"You wants to get back 'ome to your
families, don't you," he asked, "and to your
instruments and your usual ways of livin'?
Why, of course you does.  Then buck up,
and pitch in, and learn to do your dooty.  I'm
not a hard man.  I can make allowances.  I
know you didn't ship to do this.  But it's your
luck, and you must.  Now then, that'll do
the deck.  Just lay into this pump all of you,
and I'll sound 'er again."
</p>

<p>
And as good luck would have it, there soon
appeared some reason for hoping that the leaks
in the <i>Kamma Funder</i> had closed.
</p>

<p>
"Blimy," said Simpkins, "we'll 'ave 'er
sailin' like a witch yet.  Chuck yerselves into
it, and I'll call the captain."
</p>

<p>
But the captain was fast asleep in the bunk
of the late skipper.
</p>

<p>
"What's become of her crew?" asked the
new crew, as they sat round the deck and ate
their biscuit.
</p>

<p>
"Took off by a steamer," said Simpkins;
"you see they've left their boats, and the captain
says the ship's papers 'as gone, so they was
took off, for sure."
</p>

<p>
"I wish we were taken off," said the weary
astronomer.
</p>

<p>
"That'll come, I dessay," replied the
consolatory Simpkins, "but if we sails 'er 'ome,
we'll get salvage, and your time won't be wasted.
So cheer up, and let's make sail, while a
couple of you keeps the pumps a-goin'."
</p>

<p>
The wind by now was a light north-westerly
breeze, and though the barque worked heavily and
wallowed in the sea, Simpkins took her as she
went round and put the geologist at the helm.
</p>

<p>
"Keep the wind in the back o' your neck,"
said Simpkins to the nervous helmsman, "and
I'll loose the foresail."
</p>

<p>
He jumped up aloft and loosed the foresail
and two fore-topsails.  Coming down, he got
the scientific crew to work.
</p>

<p>
"Here you, ketch hold of this and pull.
There, that will do.  Belay!  Tie the thing
up, I mean, on that thing, you silly ass!"
</p>

<p>
And the member of the Royal Society, who
was thus addressed for the first time since he
had left school, made the starboard fore-sheet
fast to the cleat.
</p>

<p>
"You ain't such an ass as you wants to make
out," said Simpkins, as he watched him
critically; "me and the captain will soon put you
chaps in shape.  Now then, all of you!  Fore-topsail
'alliards!  Stretch it out and lay back.
Which of you can sing?"
</p>

<p>
They declared that none of them could.
</p>

<p>
"Then I must," said Simpkins; and he
gave them the chanty "Handily, boys, so
handy," until he had the topsail well up.
And just as the crew were looking aloft with a
strange new feeling of actual pleasure in seeing
results grow under their hands, a sudden row
arose aft.  The captain was interviewing the
geologist.
</p>

<p>
"Steer small," said Captain Prowse; "don't
work the bally wheel as if you was workin' a
chaff-cutter."
</p>

<p>
"I'm doin' my best," said the furious man
of science, "and I beg you will speak to me
civilly."
</p>

<p>
"I'll speak to you how I like," said Prowse;
"didn't I tell you a while back as you wasn't
a passenger no more, but one of my crew?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said the geologist, "I beg that you
will be so good as to refrain from speaking to
me.  I am not accustomed to be talked to in
that tone."
</p>

<p>
Captain Prowse gasped, and, walking hurriedly
to the side, endeavoured to pull a fixed belaying-pin
from the rail.  After three or four trials
he came to a loose one.  By this time the <i>Kamma
Funder</i> was yawing all abroad, and when
Captain Prowse came towards the wheel again,
the geologist let go, and in his turn sought for
a weapon.  The captain caught the wheel in
time to prevent the vessel getting right aback,
and roared:
</p>

<p>
"Mutiny, mutiny!"
</p>

<p>
Simpkins and the scientific association came
running aft.
</p>

<p>
"Simpkins," shrieked Prowse, "ketch hold
of that geological chap."
</p>

<p>
"I dare either of you to touch me," said the
geologist; "the first one that does, I'll brain
him!"
</p>

<p>
He held the iron pin firmly, and looked
desperate.
</p>

<p>
"Come and ketch hold of the wheel," said
Prowse, in a choking voice.
</p>

<p>
"No, don't let him," said the offender,
and a violent argument arose.
</p>

<p>
"This is perfectly scandalous," said the
meek astronomer, "and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We won't put up with it," cried the
entomologist.
</p>

<p>
"I must obey orders," said Simpkins.
</p>

<p>
"Or I'll murder you," screamed the skipper.
</p>

<p>
"If he lets go she'll be took aback," said
Simpkins, "and it'll be a lot of trouble."
</p>

<p>
"We don't care," said the men of science,
and then the captain let go and rushed for the
geologist.  Simpkins broke from the astronomer
and caught the spinning wheel just as the
geologist knocked the captain down.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried the pathologist, "I believe
you've killed him."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," said the hero of the occasion,
with rather a pale face, "I'm not going to be
bullied by any coarse brute of a sailor."
</p>

<p>
"But he's the captain," said Simpkins.
</p>

<p>
But mutiny was in their hearts.  They all
talked at once, and the pathologist felt the
captain's skull to see whether it was still sound.
</p>

<p>
"Will he die?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said the doctor, "he has a skull
like a ram's.  Take him below."
</p>

<p>
"And lock him in," said the astronomer.
"And we can argue with him through the door."
</p>

<p>
It was a happy thought, and even Simpkins,
in spite of his ingrained respect for the lawful
authority of the most lawless skipper, approved
the suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"You ain't all so soft as you look," said
Simpkins, "but the sea does bring the devil
out in a man if so be he's got any."
</p>

<p>
And they carried Captain Joseph Prowse
down below.  As his cabin door would not
lock, they jammed short pieces of sawed
lumber between it and the other side of the
alley way.
</p>

<p>
"It's mutiny," said Simpkins, "but it's
done, and maybe he'll cool off when he comes
to and finds his 'ead aching."
</p>

<p>
But nevertheless the situation was not
pleasant, and no one was quite certain as to
what should be done.
</p>

<p>
"Hold a committee meeting," said the
entomologist.
</p>

<p>
The others said that was nonsense.  Simpkins,
who now looked on the geologist as captain of
the mutineers, touched his hat to him, and
begged leave to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the geologist, "what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Ain't some of you gents good at instruments?"
asked Simpkins.  "For if you are,
and if you could get hold of a sextant, it would
be doin' things regular if you was to take a
sight of the sun."
</p>

<p>
The ethnologist turned to the astronomer.
</p>

<p>
"How humanity yearns for a certain
regularity!" he said; "it would really comfort
Simpkins if you would squint at the sun
through a gaspipe."
</p>

<p>
"You find me the sextant," said the
astronomer, "and I'll do it."
</p>

<p>
"What, you?" said Simpkins.  "I'd never
ha' thought it."
</p>

<p>
Though he could not be induced to say in
public why he would never have thought it, in
private he revealed to the inquisitive ethnologist
that the astronomer looked "the measliest
of the whole gang, sir."
</p>

<p>
The discussion, which had been held on deck,
with Simpkins at the wheel, was broken up by
the captain hammering furiously on his jammed
door.
</p>

<p>
"Go down and soothe him," said Simpkins
nervously, "and mind you tell him I done
nothin' but give in to superior overwhelmin'
odds.  For so I did, gentlemen, so I did, as
you know, bein' those as done it."
</p>

<p>
The committee went below, with the geologist
leading.  He carried his belaying-pin
in his pocket.  As they marched, the uproar
was tremendous.
</p>

<p>
"What a skull he must have!" said
the ethnologist.  "I wish I had it in my
collection."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," said the pathologist
</p>

<p>
And the authority on philology pressed to
the front rank, for Captain Joseph Prowse
was doing his best.
</p>

<p>
"Lemme out," he roared; "oh, when I do
get out, I'll show you what I am."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!" said the young geologist, with
firmness.
</p>

<p>
The captain gave an audible gasp.
</p>

<p>
"Shut up?" he inquired weakly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the leader, "and give us your
sextant, if you have one."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm damned," said Prowse, after a
long and striking pause.  "May I inquire if
you've took command?  For if so, and you
require my services to peel pertaters and sweep
the deck, just say so, and let me out."
</p>

<p>
"Will you be civil if we let you out?"
asked the astronomer kindly.
</p>

<p>
"Civil?" said Prowse, choking; "what do
you think?"
</p>

<p>
"We don't think you will be," replied
the astronomer, "from the tone of your
voice."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure he won't be," said the geologist.
</p>

<p>
"I think we'd better keep him where he is,"
said the rest anxiously; "why, the man's
nothing but a raging lunatic."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Prowse from within.  "Look
here, you mutineers, is Simpkins in this?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said the geologist, who showed a
little humour occasionally, "he's out of it.  He
tried to rescue you, so we hung him.  But he
came to again, and is now at the wheel.  What
about that sextant?"
</p>

<p>
"I ain't got no sextant," said Prowse sulkily.
He recognised it was no use kicking, and the
rum was dying out of his aching head.
</p>

<p>
"Then let's go on deck," said the men of
science.  "What's the use of talking to him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please," said the subdued skipper;
but they paid no attention, and returned to
Simpkins.
</p>

<p>
At various intervals during the day Prowse
made more and more pitiful appeals to be let
out.  But as the weather was clear and bright,
Simpkins and his "overwhelming odds" were at
work on deck, and paid little or no attention.
Simpkins now did not take his line from the
skipper, but, feeling that the command was in
commission, adopted the manner of the
sergeant-instructor at a gymnasium.
</p>

<p>
"Now, if a couple or four of you gentlemen
would keep the pumps going," he urged from
his station at the wheel, "we should get along
a deal better.  And if you, sir, would come
and take the wheel agin for two shakes of a
lamb's tail, I don't see no reason I shouldn't
loose the upper main-topsail."
</p>

<p>
So the geologist took the wheel while
Simpkins went aloft and loosed the upper
main-topsail.
</p>

<p>
"Supposing you wanted to have less sail
presently," said the astronomer to Simpkins,
when the topsail was set, "what would you do?"
</p>

<p>
"You gents would 'ave to 'elp stow it," said
Simpkins.
</p>

<p>
"What, go aloft?" asked the astronomer.
</p>

<p>
"And why not?" demanded Simpkins.
"It's easy, going aloft&mdash;as easy as fallin' from
the side of an 'ouse."
</p>

<p>
"So I should think," cried the astronomer,
shivering.  "I hope the weather will remain
fine."
</p>

<p>
"You know it's really remarkable how
useful such an uneducated man can be," he
said presently to some of the others.  "Now,
what use am I?"
</p>

<p>
Simpkins was passing and heard this.  He
paused and eyed the astronomer.
</p>

<p>
"Well, to speak the truth, sir," he said
sympathetically, "you ain't much; but you do what
you can at the end of a rope.  And I shouldn't
be surprised if you're all right at 'ome."
</p>

<p>
"All of which is good against vanity," said
the astronomer, as the barque under most of
her plain sail steered east-south-east into the
track of the Atlantic liners.  "And do you
know, absurd as it may seem, I am beginning
to feel very well indeed&mdash;better than I have done
for years."
</p>

<p>
As the night fell, the captain, who had by
that time lost all his alcoholic courage,
appealed for mercy.  He shouted his petition
to those on deck through the cabin port-hole.
But he tried Simpkins first.
</p>

<p>
"Simpkins," he yelled.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Simpkins, with his head over
the rail.
</p>

<p>
"Come and let me out."
</p>

<p>
"I darn't, sir," said Simpkins; "they're all
very fierce and savage agin you, especial about
your using bad language, and each of 'em 'as
a belayin'-pin and is a-watchin' of me.  It's
more than my life's worth to let you out.
And&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the skipper.
</p>

<p>
"It's more'n yours is worth too.  You must
ask 'em civil."
</p>

<p>
"<i>And give your word of honour,</i>" suggested
the ferocious geologist in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"And give your word of honour&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>To act civilly and quietly to every one.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"To act civil and quiet, sir," said Simpkins.
</p>

<p>
"<i>And not to talk too much about authority, or
drink any more rum,</i>" prompted the savage
astronomer.
</p>

<p>
"And not to be too rumbumptious, or to
get squiffy again," said Simpkins.
</p>

<p>
"For," said the brutal geologist, "if
you will agree to these terms, we shall be
glad of your advice and assistance, Captain
Prowse."
</p>

<p>
"I'll think of it," returned the skipper
sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"All right," said the rude geologist, "take
a day or two to think it over."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Lord," said Prowse hastily.  "I've
thought of it, and I agree."
</p>

<p>
And when he came on deck the savage and
ferocious scientific captains remarked in a
friendly manner that it was a fine evening.
</p>

<p>
"Damme," said the one-time skipper, "I'm
blowed if <i>I</i> ain't the crew of the <i>Kamma
Funder</i>."
</p>

<h3>
THE REHABILITATION OF THE VIGIA.
</h3>

<p>
The mate or the <i>Palembang</i> walked the
weather side of the poop, and felt just
then that he was full up to the back teeth
of the mighty sea and all its works.  He
yearned for Leith Walk or Wapping; to lie
on a hot dry beach would be heaven, for the
hot wet south-west monsoon was blowing the
<i>Palembang</i> towards Bombay, and the Maldivhs
were on the starboard beam.
</p>

<p>
Jack Wilson propped his eyes open and
cursed the slow passage of time towards midnight.
As he peered down below at the lighted
clock he was inclined to swear that the second
mate had come out and stopped it.  But
presently it was five minutes to twelve, and
to his disgust sleepiness passed away as his
relief stumbled up the poop ladder and came aft.
"Jerusalem, but it's dark," said the second
greaser, as he looked up aloft and round
about him.
</p>

<p>
"Have the gas lit," growled Wilson, as he
was going forward.
</p>

<p>
"Sulky devil!" replied the second.  "When
do you have a civil word for any one?"
</p>

<p>
This was all in the night's work, and no
one was a penny the worse.  Civility at
midnight is often too dear to be bought from
any one but an inferior; and Wilson and
Green knew each other very well.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Palembang</i> was running with the wind
on the port quarter, and for a quiet life the
old lady was under shortened canvas.  She
went at it like an old dame in wind and snow;
a reefed foresail represented picked-up
petticoats; the stowed royals and topgallant-sails
suggested that a hat with feathers had
been replaced by a handkerchief.  For the
monsoon was blowing stiff that July night
seven degrees to the north of the Line, and
threatened to blow stiffer yet.
</p>

<p>
As it was getting towards two o'clock, or
four bells, the captain came on deck, and
nodded at the binnacle when Green said:
"Good-morning, sir."  Then he spread his
legs out and considered the dark universe for
awhile.
</p>

<p>
"It has waked up a bit since I went below,
Mr. Green," he said presently; and, wanting
no answer, he got none.  The song of the
wind in the rigging and the draught under the
foot of the foresail were answer sufficient.
There was a pleasing hiss alongside as the
<i>Palembang</i> shoved through the Indian Ocean
and left a lighter wake behind.
</p>

<p>
"There's a vigia marked on the chart for
hereabouts," said Captain Spiller presently; "it
got there through that old fool Banks of
the <i>Simoom</i>.  He reported it years ago, but
it warn't never confirmed.  Rocks, he said,
and one like Cleopatra's Needle."
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't credit it either, sir?" asked
Green presently.
</p>

<p>
"I know Banks," replied Spiller, snorting,
"and never was such a man for imagination and
want of judgment.  I'd take it as proof positive
as nothing was, if he said it stood to reason
it must be.  And I'm a man as likes a clean
and decent chart.  A chart is the character
give to an ocean by them as has employed
it, a bundle of <i>chits</i>, as the Hindoo beggars
say, and to go an' lump in a suspicion agin'
the character of an ocean on the word of a
man like Banks, why, I've no patience.  I've
a notion that the law of libel ought to have
a say in it."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, sir," said Green.  "The Indian Ocean
<i>versus</i> Banks."
</p>

<p>
"And I'd believe it of Banks that he done
it just to get his name mentioned, and to
rise a bit of a palaver about him.  He's a
most conceited chap is Banks, and not by any
means the seaman he'd like to be thought.
And they actually sent a man-o'-war down
to look up his <i>Simoom</i> Rocks and they came
back and never seen 'em."
</p>

<p>
"And nobody else ever did, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," said Spiller; "they might
as well set traps to catch the rats that a man
sees when he's got the jimjams.  And nothing
makes Banks angrier than to throw out a
hint you don't believe in them rocks.  I
always gets him on it, by asking for a clean
chart and proved shoals, and what not, and
giving it him hot and heavy on vigias and
the like.  Bah, I ain't no patience."
</p>

<p>
And Spiller tramped the deck for a bit.
Presently he came back to where Green stood.
</p>

<p>
"He'll be in Bombay before us," he said
gloomily.  "I have to own the <i>Simoom's</i> faster
than the <i>Palembang</i>, but if she was sailed by a
better man she'd make quicker passages.  Why,
an engineer in a steamer can pass a thorough
sailor in a scow."
</p>

<p>
His heart was bitter, but the thought that
Her Majesty's cruiser <i>Amphion</i> had discredited
the <i>Simoom</i> vigia was balm to his inmost soul,
as he turned to go below.
</p>

<p>
"Keep a bright look-out," he growled, and
he left Green to consider the matter of vigias
in general, and the <i>Simoom</i> vigia in particular.
</p>

<p>
For these vigias, the terror of seamen, are
like malicious spirits.  Some man has seen them,
or has imagined them, and for ever after they
bear sway in the minds of those who sail upon
the great deep.  Perhaps they are but a floating
mass of wreck, on which the sea breaks; in
the south, what was seen was, it may be, a
drifting berg; on the shores of West Africa,
perchance a river has sent out a floating island.
Any accident of imagination may create them;
alcohol bears them on its tide: they are the
rats and ghosts and terrible creeping things
of the delirium of the sea that is born of rum.
A heavy heeled spar as it floats becomes a
pinnacle of rock; the boat that bears dead
men in it is for ever after to be avoided.  Here
a rip of currents, and there a heavy overfall,
become fixed terrors and are given names.
</p>

<p>
For this is the sea that is unknown yet,
and shall for ever be unknown.  It works upon
the mind of man very subtly, and yet again
with tremendous strength.  Under the sea are
earthquakes, and in it volcanoes.  Of these
islands are born, and again they pass away,
while the little creature man skims upon the
surface of the ocean like a water-beetle, and
may be seen no more.
</p>

<p>
When Green was left alone upon the poop
of the <i>Palembang</i>, save for the presence of the
man at the wheel, something of the wonderful
majesty of the sea came down upon him, and
for a moment touched his nerves.  Trust in
the captain he had none, for Spiller was of the
usual alcoholic order; so he got out the chart
and looked at it.  There stood the vigia
marked "Simoom Rock."  Perhaps it existed
after all.  He remembered the history of the
Aurora Islands to the cast of the Falklands.
Even now, some old sailors believe there are
such islands, real land, not ice grounded on
deep soundings.  And the Simoom vigia was
close at hand, if it existed at all.  Allowing for
sufficient uncertainty in its supposed position,
it might be anywhere within a degree.  He
stared out into the darkness and imagined
he saw it.  It was here, it was there, it was
nowhere: it was a wraith of the mind, and
dissolved.  He put back his night-glasses, and
whistled, till he remembered there was quite
enough wind, and that he had no desire to
turn the hands up to shorten sail.
</p>

<p>
"Jerusalem, it is dark," he said again, and
he recalled Wilson's reply, "Have the gas
lit."  Aye, that would be pleasant.  For a moment
he saw the streets of London town with a
diminuendo in lamps, and then he pulled
himself together.  It breezed up a bit and
was four bells.  He hove the log, and went
along the lee side to go below to enter it on
the slate.  She made a biggish weather roll, and
the decks being slippery, he steadied himself
and put his head outside the rail to take a look
ahead.  And at that moment, as he says, he saw
the Simoom vigia.  His heart stood still, and
then thumped furiously.  In spite of the hiss of
the seas, and the windy roar of the rigging,
the sound of his pulse in his ears was like the
sound of a pump.  He was paralysed, and yet
he knew that the <i>Palembang</i> was rushing on
destruction.
</p>

<p>
"Hard a starboard!" he said coolly, but
in a choking voice.
</p>

<p>
"Sir?" said the astounded man at the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"Hard a starboard, damn you," said Green
fiercely.
</p>

<p>
And the helmsman ground the wheel hard
down with the air of a surprised martyr.
As the <i>Palembang</i> bowed and came round
almost at right angles to her former course,
Green swears he saw broken water, though
he lost the sharp pinnacle of rock he had
seen at first.
</p>

<p>
Old Spiller, who was not asleep, came up
on deck in a hurry.
</p>

<p>
"What's she off her course for?"
</p>

<p>
Green told him, and Spiller swore.
</p>

<p>
"You saw nothing, you damn fool."
</p>

<p>
"I did."
</p>

<p>
"You didn't, you imaginative ass."
</p>

<p>
Green wanted to plant his fist between
Spiller's eyes, but did not; for he was a
married man and hated to lose a job.  He
ground his teeth and turned away.  The
<i>Palembang</i> was put on her course again, and
after interrogating the man on the look-out
and the man at the wheel, who acknowledged
they had seen nothing, the skipper swore
promiscuously at everything, and went below to
lay his soul in soak.
</p>

<p>
"What one man sees another'll look for,
and what a fool looks for a fool will see," he
cried, without knowing what a neat addition
he had made to the subject of suggestion.
And by the time that Wilson relieved him
at four o'clock Green was curiously uncertain
as to whether he had seen straight or not.
</p>

<p>
"Now, did you?" asked Wilson.
</p>

<p>
"Two hours ago I'd have sworn to
it," said the second mate, scratching his
head.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've a notion you did," cried Wilson.
"Between you and me and the mizzen-mast,
I think Banks is a right smart man."
</p>

<p>
"I believe I can swear I saw it," said young
Green, much encouraged.  "Yes, there were
at least three rocks, one of them a pinnacle
like an obelisk."
</p>

<p>
And with Wilson secretly on his side, he was
quite sure of it before they reached Bombay,
though Spiller was for ever jeering at him, and
making the ship as uncomfortable as he could.
</p>

<p>
"Mebbe you can see ghosts, too," he was
constantly suggesting.
</p>

<p>
"I'll quit at Bombay if he'll give me my
discharge," said Green.
</p>

<p>
And sure enough Spiller did, when he met
Green on the Apollo Bunda in a confidential
yarn with Banks, who, for a seaman of the
old class, was a very gentlemanly man with
neat white whiskers.
</p>

<p>
"You've been encouraging him about that
vigia," roared Spiller, and when he wrote out
Green's discharge, he offered to give him a
special character for seeing ghosts.
</p>

<p>
"But not rats!" said Green nastily, as he
put his discharge into his pocket; for the last
time Spiller overdrank himself he had a very
bad time with rodents.
</p>

<p>
It was the best of luck for Green that he
got out of the <i>Palembang</i>, for Banks's mate fell
ill, and the second had no mate's ticket.  So
Green, being in great favour, through having
seen the poor discredited Simoom vigia, got the
job, for he had passed for mate just before
signing as second in the <i>Palembang</i>.
</p>

<p>
Banks took him round with him, and again
tackled the captain of the <i>Amphion</i> about
that vigia, showing his new witness; but
Captain Melville shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"The old man is crazy about those rocks,"
was all he said, as he refused to discuss the
matter.
</p>

<p>
But Banks and Spiller went at it hammer
and tongs when they met ashore.
</p>

<p>
"He saw nothing," said Spiller.
</p>

<p>
"Only what I saw."
</p>

<p>
"I told the fool about it and he imagined
the rest, as you did."
</p>

<p>
Banks fumed.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky you didn't run the <i>Palembang</i> on
my imagination.  Slow as she goes, she'd have
slammed herself into matchwood."
</p>

<p>
Spiller choked with rage.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, I'll sail all over your blooming
rocks, as I have done afore.  You just made
this up to get notoriety, and have your ship's
name on the chart, and be put in the Directory.
I know you, Banks, and I don't think much
of you, and never did.  To get yourself talked
about you'd report that you'd seen the <i>Flying
Dutchman</i>.  Vigias, indeed!  A disfigurement
on any chart!  You'll have the chart of the
Indian Ocean as big a disgrace as the North
Atlantic if you have your way.  Didn't you
find nothing new to report this time?"
</p>

<p>
Banks rose up in a towering rage.
</p>

<p>
"You're no gentleman, Captain Spiller, and
I'll speak no more with you, not till you own
that the Simoom Rocks are real.  And may
you never have occasion to rue finding them
out as such.  I'll let you know I've as great a
respect for the chart as you have, and if you
ever run your old tub on my rocks, you can
call 'em Spiller's Reef, for all I care, so there,"
and he perspired off to his vessel.
</p>

<p>
In shipping circles opinion was divided
between the master of the <i>Simoom</i> and the
master of the <i>Palembang</i>.  And it being the
fashion of the sailorman, or, for that matter,
of human-kind in general, to decide matters that
admit of doubt according to personal prejudice
and ancient opinion, there were more on Spiller's
side than on Banks's.  For one thing, it is the
perpetual ambition of all true sons of the ocean
to discover something new and have his ship's
name tagged on to it, and every one was jealous
of Banks.  When the <i>Amphion</i> looked for the
rocks without success, they threw out dark hints
about a dead whale or a tree stump having
been seen, and some said "Rum," just as
others said "Rats," contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
Others, with a very fine contempt for the
Navy, were of opinion that Captain Melville
of H.M.S. <i>Amphion</i> considered he owned half
the Indian Ocean and all the Arabian Sea, and
would be as much put out at finding an
unmarked rock or shoal in either as if he
slipped upon an old chew on his own quarterdeck.
These were on Banks's side, of course.
And some who disliked Spiller said they believed
in this new set of rocks to annoy him, ending
very naturally in holding the opinion they
argued for.
</p>

<p>
When old Banks got on the high horse
and swore he would not speak again to the
disbeliever in the vigia, he meant it, and added
details to his statement.
</p>

<p>
"Not if I found him in a boat in the middle
of the Indian Ocean," he swore excitedly.
</p>

<p>
The quarrel was as bitter as polemic theology.
Spiller was a rank atheist, a scorner, a scoffer,
a pagan, a heathen.  If Banks had written a
new creed, he would have begun it: "I
believe in the <i>Simoom</i> Rocks to the west of
the Maldivhs."  He clung to their existence
pathetically, and when an impecunious skipper
of a storm-disgruntled tramp wanted to borrow
a couple of hundred rupees from him, and
remarked incidentally that he had seen broken
water in the supposed position of the discredited
reef, Banks forked out with enthusiasm and took
down a lying statement joyfully.
</p>

<p>
But when the <i>Simoom</i> was ready for sea again,
that same tramp skipper, who was a wild
disgrace to the respectable mystery of the sea,
executed a few manoeuvres which let the
<i>Palembang</i> get ahead of her.  For the tramp
(<i>Julius Cæsar</i> was her name) had engines of
an obstinate and eccentric character.  Sometimes
they worked, and sometimes they didn't, and
on this particular occasion they refused to be
reversed at any price.  As the <i>Julius Cæsar</i>
wouldn't go astern, her captain shoved her at
the crowded shipping ahead and put her through,
whooping on the bridge like a maniac.  He
grazed three other steamers, took a bumpkin
off a sailing vessel, slipped between two others,
and in one last complicated evolution smashed
the jibboom of the <i>Simoom</i>, brought down her
fore-topgall'n'-mast, and escaped to sea in a
cyclone of curses of which the calm centre was
the <i>Palembang</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I'll report you," said Spiller to Banks, when
he left Bombay.
</p>

<p>
"Go to hell," cried Banks, who rarely
swore save in a gale of wind.
</p>

<p>
"After you," said Spiller, with what is
popularly known as truly Oriental politeness;
and as a parting taunt he sang out, "What
about them rocks?"
</p>

<p>
"You're an ungrammatical, uneducated man,"
screamed Banks, dancing furiously.
</p>

<p>
But Green and Wilson waved their caps
to each other.  For all their way of passing
compliments when one gave the other a
Western Ocean relief at midnight, they were
good friends.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Simoom</i> got to sea inside of forty-eight
hours, for Banks lost no time.  He had made
up his mind to waste some on the next chance
he had of looking for his blessed rocks, unless
the monsoon blew too hard.
</p>

<p>
They had a fairly decent show running
down the coast on the inside of the Laccadivhs,
and, taking the usual circumbendibus to the
eastward between Keeling and the Chagos Archipelago,
picked up beautiful "passage" winds and
south-east trades, and went home booming.
Green found Banks a first-class "old man,"
and the <i>Simoom</i> as comfortable as a good bar
parlour, compared with the sorry old
bug-haunted <i>Palembang</i>, where a man's toes got
sore with the pedicuring work of cockroaches.
He made up his mind to stick to her, as he
evidently suited Banks.  They both got cracked
a little on the <i>Simoom</i> Rocks, and gradually
talked themselves into the belief of a
shark's-tooth reef a mile long with one special fang
that rivalled a young peak of Teneriffe.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Palembang</i> came into Liverpool River
about three weeks after the <i>Simoom</i>, and Green,
back at work after ten days at home, had a
high time with Wilson.  But the skippers
passed each other with their noses in the air
as high as squirrels' tails, and never swopped a
word in a fortnight.
</p>

<p>
As luck would have it, they were both for
Bombay again, only to give Spiller a chance
of getting there first, the <i>Simoom</i> was to call
at the Cape.  Just before the <i>Palembang</i>
cleared, Banks and Spiller fell up against
each other on the landing stage, and as
Spiller was full up to his back-teeth and
uvula, he broke silence and went for the
upholder of the vigia in high style.  He could
have taken a first-class in bad language at any
Australian back-blocks academy of cursing&mdash;and
what they don't know in blasphemy there
can only be learnt from a low-class Spaniard.
So the air was blue from Liverpool to
Manchester, and to the Isle of Man, and Banks
got up and left.  For when he was ashore
he was very religious.  Even at sea he
carried a prayer-book and an odd volume of
virulent sermons, of the kind which indicate
that no man need forgive any enemy who is
not of the same persuasion.  But to tell the
truth, Banks could have forgiven anything
but an insult to his beloved rocks.
</p>

<p>
"Such a man oughtn't to live," he cried
angrily, as he went off in a tremulous rage.
"He's predestined to the pit!"
</p>

<p>
And he trusted that Providence might one
day yield him a chance of getting even.  His
prayers were fervent towards that end, and
if Providence works, as it sometimes appears
to do, through rum and ignorance and a good
conceit in a man, there was a chance of his
appeals being attended to.
</p>

<p>
On the passage out to the Cape they saw
nothing of the <i>Palembang</i>.  But there she was
heard of as having being seen somewhere in
the neighbourhood of the Agulhas Bank,
having a real good time in that native home
of the god of the winds, where fifty per
cent. of all the breezes that do blow are gales
that dance in and out and about like a cooper
round a cask.
</p>

<p>
But the <i>Simoom</i> had luck, and slipped through
as if Æolus never spotted her.  And old Banks
chortled happily, and sang an extra hymn on
Sunday, compensating the men (otherwise
disposed to growl at the innovation) with an
extra lot of grog.  For your true sailorman
is the real conservative, and things that don't
happen in the first week of a new ship have
no business to happen afterwards&mdash;which is
a hint some young second mates may find
handy to remember.  And remembering this
will enable you to see why no true old
shellback will ship in a steamboat, any more than
the guard of a coach would let himself to
any beastly new railroad.
</p>

<p>
The south-west monsoon had backed down
to the Line about the time they crossed it;
and the <i>Simoom</i> sweated up to the Maldivhs
very comfortably.
</p>

<p>
"We've made a good passage&mdash;a ripping good
passage," said old Banks, rubbing his hands,
"and I'm condemned if I don't shape a course
for my rocks, Mr. Green."
</p>

<p>
As he had been shaping for them ever since
he had deliberately gone out of his way to
take the route east of Madagascar, instead of
the Inner or Mozambique route, Green winked
the other eye and said nothing.  To tell the
truth, he himself had a hankering to set his
mind at rest on the subject, for he felt his
credit involved with the skipper's.
</p>

<p>
The man at the wheel overheard what Banks
said, and when he stumped for'ard the whole
crew knew that the <i>Simoom</i> was looking for a
needle in the Indian Ocean.
</p>

<p>
"A life's job, my bullies," said their
informant.  "We'll be like the crew of the
<i>Flying Dutchman</i> yet."
</p>

<p>
"I'm wondering whether Spiller came up
this way, now," said old Banks presently, with
an interrogative cock of his head.
</p>

<p>
"And not by the channel?" asked Green.
</p>

<p>
Banks turned about.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Green, may the Lord forgive me,
but I just hate that Spiller with an unholy
hatred.  Every time he gets a show he brags
he's run right over where I located my rocks,
and not only that, but criss-cross in the latitude
where they might be.  And he set about that
he'd herring-boned a course on the chart on the
longitude, going back and forth on it like a
dog in a turnip field.  So now he'll be up
here again to have another shy for it.  If he
saw 'em, he'd swear he never.  And why he
hates me so I can't tell, unless it was I did my
duty once, and let him know what a God-fearing
man thought of a blasphemer."
</p>

<p>
Green nodded.
</p>

<p>
"That's likely it, sir."
</p>

<p>
"So it is, so it is," cried Banks pensively;
"he has no grace in him, and he set it about,
I know, that I soak at sea if I'm sober ashore.
He said my rocks were delirium tremens;
and I'm a discredited man, wounded in a
tender spot."
</p>

<p>
It was just four bells in the forenoon watch
then, and soon after they snugged her down,
as the wind was very heavy in puffs and the
sky low and dark.  Just before eight bells
Green spotted a vessel on the starboard bow,
and called the old man.  He came on deck
like a whiteheaded Jack-in-the-Box.
</p>

<p>
"Keep her away," he cried.  "I'll bet she's
the <i>Palembang</i>.  Shake out them reefs and
hoist the main-t'gall'n's'l again."
</p>

<p>
His grammar failed in excitement.
</p>

<p>
"We're overhauling her hand over hand,
anyhow," suggested Green.
</p>

<p>
"If I can pass him going two foot for his
one, I'd run the <i>Simoom</i> under," screamed the
skipper.  "And when we come up with him,
if my voice in a trumpet can carry, I'll tell
him what I think of him.  He thinks I'm
soft because I sing hymns on Sunday.  I'll
let him know before I sang hymns I was the
biggest tough on the Australian coast.  God's
truth I was!  And I wish I was now&mdash;oh, how
I wish it, and him ashore with me!"
</p>

<p>
And Green believed it, because he had to!
There was something in the old man's eye as
he walked to and fro, an unregenerate blood-thirsty
snap, that was very convincing.  So the
reefs were shaken out of the topsails, and even
that did not satisfy the skipper.
</p>

<p>
"I'll let him know that a saved and repentant
Christian isn't necessary a worm," said Banks.
"Mr. Green, set the mainsail!"
</p>

<p>
The <i>Simoom</i> was snoring through it now, and
Green stared.
</p>

<p>
"What she can't carry she may drag," said
the skipper, with flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
And the <i>Simoom</i> lost her courtesy with the
sea under the influence of the mainsail, for
the monsoon was a stiff one.  She shouldered
the Indian Ocean aside like a policeman
shoving through a crowd; she scooped up tons
of it as a scraper team scoops sand, and ran
at any extra sea like a bull at a hedge.  The
men were under the break of the t'gallant
foc'sle, sheltering from the cataract.  They
knew the <i>Palembang</i> was ahead, and were as
eager as the skipper to overhaul her.  Through
the bos'on and his mate it had leaked out
that the old man was keen for a palaver with
Spiller.
</p>

<p>
"He's like a bull whale in a flurry," said one
who had been whaling.  "Now my notion is
that the skipper kin blaspheme if he wants to."
</p>

<p>
The <i>Palembang</i> was visibly herself and no
other vessel by this time, and she carried all
she could stand.
</p>

<p>
"I've half a notion to have the t'gall'n-sails
set," said Banks, looking up aloft.  "And
if we weren't overhauling her twenty-three to
the dozen, damme, but I would!"
</p>

<p>
For the <i>Palembang</i> showed nothing above
her reefed topsails, and the foresail had a reef
in it, and the <i>Simoom</i> came after her like the
inside edge of a cyclone.
</p>

<p>
"Gimme my trumpet," cried Banks.  "Mr. Green,
take the wheel, and run her as close as
maybe."
</p>

<p>
And the second mate stood at the main-topsail
halliards.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Palembang</i> ahoy!" yelled Banks through
his trumpet as he came tearing up on the
weather side of his enemy's ship.
</p>

<p>
"Where the blue blazes are you coming
to?" shrieked Spiller, who was both drunk and
angry.
</p>

<p>
"Passing you as if you was standing still,
you low, uneducated swine," said Banks.
"And I could do it under jury rig."
</p>

<p>
"What about them rocks?" jeered Spiller
through his trumpet.  "What's the price of
vigias, you notorious old liar, you disgrace to
the perfession?"
</p>

<p>
They were close alongside now, not half a
cable's length apart; a good cricketer could
have shied a cricket ball the distance easily.
</p>

<p>
"Leggo the main-topsail halliards," said
Banks, and then to the surprise of his crew and
the utter astonishment of Spiller he poured
out a torrent of the most blood-curdling abuse
which had ever defiled the Indian or any other
ocean.
</p>

<p>
"You think I'm soft, you dog," he boomed
through his spurt of blasphemy, "and reckon
because I've got notions of decency I'm to be
trod on.  Run on my rocks and sink and burn."
</p>

<p>
His voice rose to a scream and cracked.  He
tried to speak, but tried in vain.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Green, here," he whispered, and
leaving the wheel to the man he had displaced,
the mate jumped to the lee poop rail.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him he's no sailor; my voice is
gone.  Say he's a&mdash;oh, tell him anything you
feel."
</p>

<p>
Green did so, and satisfied himself and Banks
and the entire crew.  And then, seeing Wilson,
he gave him a friendly bellow.
</p>

<p>
"What cheer, Wilson!"
</p>

<p>
And hoisting the topsails, they ran on, leaving
Spiller choking with helpless rage.
</p>

<p>
As it grew darker and they dropped the
<i>Palembang</i> they picked up the mainsail, and
shortened down for the night.
</p>

<p>
"We ain't in no hurry," whispered Banks,
"and to-morrow we'll be up with my rocks,
if I've hit it off right."
</p>

<p>
He was now sombre and dignified, and spoke
with particular grammatical and moral accuracy.
Not the ghost of a damn issued from his lips.
He reproved Green for swearing, and held a
service in the cabin, much to the disgust of the
entire ship, as it wasn't Sunday.  Perhaps to
punish himself, for he always liked to stand
well with the crowd, he gave them no grog
after it.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he sent a man on the
fore-topgallant-yard looking for his rocks, and
as he gave notice that any one who sighted
them first should have five pounds, the entire
watch, which should have been below snoring,
sat like crows up aloft and strained their eyes
all round the horizon.
</p>

<p>
At ten Banks was jovial and got his voice
back.  At noon he was anxious.  By four
o'clock he shortened sail again.
</p>

<p>
"We've overrun 'em," he said sadly.  "If
they're still about, we're to the west of 'em.
Mr. Green, during the night we'll stand under
easy sail to the eastward.  I'm set on seeing
those rocks again, if I lose a week."
</p>

<p>
And the night fell darkly.
</p>

<p>
No matter whose watch it was, mate's or
second mate's, the white-whiskered skipper
was on deck every ten minutes, peering into
the black darkness with his glasses.  The old
chap's nerves were on edge; his imagination
flamed; he saw reefs and pinnacles of islands
every moment, and heard the boom of breakers.
</p>

<p>
When Green relieved his subordinate at
midnight, the second mate whispered to him:
</p>

<p>
"The old man's as nervous as a cat.  To
hear him jaw you'd think the bottom of the
sea was rising up.  Mind you ain't high and
dry on a new continent by daylight."
</p>

<p>
"We'll whack it out fair among the lot
of us," said Green.  "Jeewhillikins, what's
that?"
</p>

<p>
He spoke suddenly, in an altered voice, and
Milton jumped.
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought I saw a flare to the southward."
</p>

<p>
"Lordy, you've got them too," said Milton.
"Let's go ashore, and have a walk on the
Apollo Bunda."
</p>

<p>
"Stow it," cried Green, and holding on
to the mizzen-topgallant backstay, he jumped
upon the rail.
</p>

<p>
"Look, look!" he cried, and Milton, looking,
saw a faint glow to the southward&mdash;or fancied
he saw it.
</p>

<p>
"Call the old man," said Green, and in two
and three-fifths seconds by any man's chronometer,
Banks was on deck, and saw nothing.
</p>

<p>
"But did ye see it, man?" he yelled; "and
if so, what's it mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Some one struck a match in Colombo,"
said the second mate irreverently.  For he
had sailed with Banks for years, and at times
took liberties.
</p>

<p>
"I only trust to Providence that it isn't
that wicked man's ship in any trouble," said
the skipper viciously.  "Mr. Green, we'll
stand to the south'ard for a while."
</p>

<p>
"Lay aft the watch," sang out Milton, and
they braced her up to within two points of
the wind.
</p>

<p>
Both watches stayed on deck in the little
excitement, and in the course of the next hour
they reported all kinds of non-existent things.
"Rocks on the starboard bow" were varied
by "A vessel on the port bow," and a planet
low down in a break of cloud was "A steamer's
head-light, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Collision with Venus," cried Milton.
</p>

<p>
But just in the 'twixt and 'tween of earliest
dawn, when the grey ghost of day walked in
the east, a man up aloft sang out with startling
energy:
</p>

<p>
"Two dark rocks right ahead, sir."
</p>

<p>
The main-deck hummed suddenly, and a
patter of bare feet told that the entire crew had
run for the foc'sle head.  The skipper nipped
into the mizzen rigging quick as a chipmunk.
</p>

<p>
"Keep her away a point or two," he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Away a point or two, sir," echoed the helmsman.
</p>

<p>
"I see 'em, Mr. Green," yelled the old chap;
"and just where I figured them out to be.
There'll be three, there'll be three."
</p>

<p>
He paused and looked down on Green.
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but two will do me," he added
cautiously.  "I never pinned my faith to three."
</p>

<p>
Green climbed alongside him, and even a
bit higher.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, sir, they're boats," he cried.
</p>

<p>
"No, rocks," said the skipper.
</p>

<p>
"Boats," repeated the mate, obstinately.
</p>

<p>
"So they are!  Damn!" cried the skipper.
</p>

<p>
And then the same verdict came from aloft,
and was confirmed by the entire sea jury.
</p>

<p>
The disappointed captain dropped back on deck.
</p>

<p>
"Now, if they were the <i>Palembang's</i> boats,"
suggested Green.
</p>

<p>
"No such luck," said the skipper.  "Is
there any one in 'em, and do they see us?"
</p>

<p>
"By the same token they see us now!"
shouted Green, and in a quarter of an hour
the boats were alongside, and the <i>Simoom</i>
lay to.
</p>

<p>
"What boats are those?" squealed Banks.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Palembang's</i>," replied a voice from
the tumbling cockleshells.
</p>

<p>
The skipper and the mates said "Whew!"
and Banks was fairly dancing.
</p>

<p>
"And where's your ship?"
</p>

<p>
"Bottom of the Indian Ocean," said a voice
that Banks recognised as Spiller's.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Captain Spiller?" he inquired,
with much exaggerated courtesy.
</p>

<p>
"It is," growled Spiller.
</p>

<p>
"Did you by any chance come across my
rocks as you sailed along so pleasant?"
</p>

<p>
Spiller swore in a muffled voice.
</p>

<p>
"Not by your description of 'em: far from
it," he replied at last.
</p>

<p>
"We'll see about that," said Banks.  "Now
then, come under the lee quarter, and we'll have
some of you aboard; the captain of the
<i>Palembang</i> last."
</p>

<p>
"Whad yer mean?" cried Spiller sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"What I say," said Banks softly.
</p>

<p>
And when every one was out of the boats
but Spiller, he stood by the line.
</p>

<p>
"Now, captain, were they my rocks or not?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Spiller.
</p>

<p>
"Then stay in your damned boat," cried
Banks.  "Cast that line off, Spiller.  You
won't?  Then cut it, Mr. Green."
</p>

<p>
Green smiled but didn't move.  The skipper
borrowed a knife from the nearest seaman by
taking it out of its sheath.
</p>

<p>
"Now, was they or not?"
</p>

<p>
"No," cried Spiller.
</p>

<p>
"One, two, and at three I cut," said Banks.
"One&mdash;two&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, they was, then," shrieked Spiller;
and the next minute he was on deck.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have you sign a paper to that effect,"
said Banks, "and if you don't, the whole of
your crew will, including your mate."
</p>

<p>
Wilson, who was standing by Green, said
that he would willingly, and when Spiller
scowled, he scowled back.
</p>

<p>
"And now, Mr. Green," cried Banks
cheerfully, "since we know where they are, and
can find 'em any time, you may put her on her
course again.  And we'll have a little
thanksgiving service for all this."
</p>

<p>
He did not explain whether the service was
for the established character of the Simoom
Rocks, or for the rescue of the shipwrecked
crew, but when he got them all below he
handed round hymn books.
</p>

<p>
"First of all we will sing hymn No. 184 of
Hymns Ancient and Modern," he said softly,
and when Spiller looked it up he was very
much annoyed.
</p>

<h3>
THREE IN A GAME.
</h3>

<p>
Things were quiet in San Francisco&mdash;that
is to say, though the usual blackguards
spouted on the Sand-Lot on Sundays, there was
no great political row on.  The President of
the United States had still three years to run
before any chance of a second term, and local
politics had quietened.  The Governor of the
State, though an angel to one side and a
devil to the other, had been "let up on" at
last, and the reporters for the daily papers had
to invent "stories" to keep themselves going.
That only kept their hand in.  It was a
blessing to them without any disguise when the
rivalry between young Jack Hunt and Sibley
Gawthrop for the hand and the money and
the affections of Edith Atherton became public
property.  It was most of all a blessing to
Gardiner, the smartest new man on the San
Francisco <i>Chronicle</i>, who knew both of the
boys well.
</p>

<p>
For how could any "story" fail to pay
dividends when two of the swagger
"Anglo-Franco-Californians," the most beautiful girl
on the coast, and Shanghai Smith, the most
scoundrelly boarding-house keeper on the
Pacific, played leading parts in the drama?
And when one reflects that San Francisco, the
Pacific itself and the Atlantic, and the Sailors'
Home in Well Street, London, came into the
newspaper play quite naturally, it seems obvious
there was meat for any reporter's teeth.
</p>

<p>
Gardiner, of course, was not in the high-toned
gang to which Hunt and Gawthrop belonged,
but he knew them both very well, although he
had only been in California a short year.  He
knew every one in San Francisco, from the
biggest toughs on Telegraph Hill, and the
political bosses, to the big pots and their
womankind.  He knew Miss Atherton too.
He wanted to know her better.  Though he
was on the staff of the <i>Chronicle</i>, it was his own
fault.  If he could have only got on with his
father in New York, he might have been as
rich as Hunt himself.  But the boy who cannot
differ on vital points with his father before he
is sixteen is no true American, and Gardiner
was U.S. to his fingertips.
</p>

<p>
"I'll get there yet," said Gardiner.  His
chance was coming.  There are more ways of
succeeding than one.
</p>

<p>
"How is it you bow to a reporter on the
<i>Chronicle</i>, my dear?" asked a friend of Edith
Atherton's.  "I understand that is what he is."
</p>

<p>
"I do it because he might have been my
brother," said Edith Atherton.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean that his father nearly married my
mother," said Edith; "but he was too
autocratic, and he married an Englishwoman.  I
don't wonder George Gardiner could not hit
it off with him.  Poor boy!  I wish he could."
</p>

<p>
Certainly he was far finer-looking than either
Hunt or Gawthrop&mdash;that is the way her
friend interpreted the girl's sigh.
</p>

<p>
"And he's cleverer too," said the older
woman acutely, "nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And "nevertheless" was very easy to interpret.
</p>

<p>
"Which will it be, I wonder?" said her
friend.
</p>

<p>
The solution lay on the knees of the gods,
and in the hands of Shanghai Smith.
</p>

<p>
That night Hunt met Gardiner at the club
by chance, and stayed with him all the
evening.
</p>

<p>
"What are you looking so down about?"
asked the newspaper man.  "You are drinking
too much.  Ease up on it."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Hunt was drinking too much.  He
drank enough to loosen his tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Damn that Gawthrop," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I see," cried Gardiner; "is that it?"
</p>

<p>
And Hunt nodded sulkily.  Then he wept.
</p>

<p>
"If he was only out of the way," he moaned,
"I believe I could work the racket with her."
</p>

<p>
Gardiner shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well, buck up.  Come on.  I'm going
to the office."
</p>

<p>
They walked into Kearney Street and turned
east towards the <i>Chronicle</i> offices.  As they
passed Bush Street a very hard-looking citizen
nodded to Gardiner.
</p>

<p>
"Who's that?" asked Hunt.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know him?  That's Shanghai
Smith, the biggest scoundrel unhung.  He's a
sailors' crimp, and a daylight robber, and a
man with a 'pull.'"
</p>

<p>
Certainly Smith had some political power.
In the United States it is impossible to avoid
politics and the police at the same time, except
by lavish bribery.
</p>

<p>
"And why do they call him 'Shanghai'?"
asked Hunt.
</p>

<p>
"Because he 'shanghais' men," answered
Gardiner, "and nowadays that means drugging
a man and putting him aboard some ship.
Oh, he's a daisy.  He'd ship your dad to New
York round the Horn if there was money in
it.  When a man disappears in this city we
look first in the morgue, and then make
inquiries at Smith's."
</p>

<p>
"I wish Gawthrop was in the morgue, I
do," said Hunt "And here I'll say good-night.
You're a good chap, Gardiner, if you
are a newspaper man, and it's been a relief to
talk to you, so it has."
</p>

<p>
They shook hands and parted, but Gardiner
had not walked ten yards before he turned
and came back.  His eyes glittered curiously.
Hunt's were blurred and fishy.  He had
certainly taken a little too much.  Gardiner
wondered if he had taken too much to
remember in the morning what happened now.
</p>

<p>
"You wish he was in the morgue, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," said Hunt firmly.  "I do."
</p>

<p>
"Why not get him shanghaied?" asked
Gardiner, and he walked away very swiftly,
and did not return when Hunt called to him.
</p>

<p>
"By the Great Horn Spoon and the tail
of the Sacred Bull, I'll not give her up," said
Gardiner; "certainly not to a man like Hunt,
or to a dude like Gawthrop.  Sooner than
that I'll write to the old man and squeal.
He'll rub it in, but after all he is the dad,
and she&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Ah, she was everything.
</p>

<p>
"Let the best man win.  I'm in the game,
after all," said Gardiner.  "And to think if
she hadn't recognised me to-day I'd have
thrown it up!"
</p>

<p>
He was not surprised to see Hunt the next
afternoon, though every one else in the office
was astonished to see him looking for a mere
reporter.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember what you said to me
last night?" asked Hunt rather nervously.
</p>

<p>
"About what?"
</p>

<p>
"About somebody called Shanghai Smith?"
</p>

<p>
He stared out of the window as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I remember, Hunt."
</p>

<p>
"Can it be done?"
</p>

<p>
"Can what be done?"
</p>

<p>
"Could I get rid of that Gawthrop for a
month or two?"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't be surprised, if you put up
the dollars."
</p>

<p>
"Will you help me?"
</p>

<p>
"And get myself&mdash;disliked?"
</p>

<p>
He was going to say&mdash;"get myself in the
penitentiary," but on reflection he did not
desire to frighten Hunt.  After all, the affair
would cause so much laughter that legal
proceedings were not likely to rise out
of it.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want you to show.  Only give
me a pointer.  Could you bring this Smith
to me?"
</p>

<p>
Gardiner stabbed his desk with a pen-knife,
and considered the matter for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," he said, "I want to deal
as squarely as I can with you.  I don't want
either you or Gawthrop to marry this
particular lady."
</p>

<p>
Hunt stared at him.
</p>

<p>
"You don't?  Oh!  I say, Gardiner&mdash;&mdash;"
and he burst into laughter, which Gardiner
apparently did not resent.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know I'm a newspaper dog, and
so on; let that be.  If I chose to crawl down
and go East, I could stack dollar for dollar
with half of you in time.  What I'm telling
you is this: I think Gawthrop has more show
than you, and I'd be glad to get him out
of the way, just as he'd no doubt be glad to get
you out.  I'll help if you'll hold your tongue
about me, whatever happens."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Hunt; "I give you my word."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever happens?"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever happens."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I shall do everything I can to win."
</p>

<p>
"That's only natural," said Hunt; "but
I'll bet you a thousand dollars that if I get
Gawthrop out of the way I'll marry Miss
Atherton inside of three months."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever happens?"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever happens."
</p>

<p>
"Then I take that bet," said Gardiner,
"and to-morrow you shall meet Shanghai."
</p>

<p>
But when Hunt had gone, Gardiner winked
steadily at nothing and stroked his chin.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott, this <i>is</i> a game," he said.
"I wonder where Gawthrop is?"
</p>

<p>
But before he found out he sat down and
wrote a letter to the elder Gardiner in New
York.  It was late that evening before he
went down to that undesirable quarter of San
Francisco known as the Barbary Coast, where
Shanghai Smith had his sailor-robbing den
located.
</p>

<p>
As he went along the water-front and saw
the ships lying at the wharves, it was "plumb"
dark.  Though he knew every tough in the
city, he walked some way from the edge of the
wharves and kept his hand on his six-shooter in
the right-hand pocket of his coat.  There is
never any knowing what may happen in the low
quarters of that sink of the Pacific, where all the
scum of the world gathers, and it is well to
keep one's eyes skinned lest worse may befall.
Gardiner had no desire to turn up on a trestle
at the morgue as his next public appearance.
But though he was careful, he went cheerfully,
and could not help laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott, to think of Sibley Gawthrop as
an able seaman on board the <i>Harvester</i> or the
<i>Wanderer</i>!  But won't it do him good?  These
young Californians are a rotten crowd."
</p>

<p>
He came at last to Smith's house, and stepped
upon the verandah floor boldly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's Mr. Gardiner of the <i>Chronicle</i>,
so it is," said Billy, who was Smith's runner,
and, next to his boss and a few politicians, the
hardest case in California.  "Is it Mr. Smith
you want to see, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm only just doing a run around, and thought
I'd look in, Billy," said Gardiner carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, just a <i>cultus nannitch</i>, as they say in
Chinook," replied Billy.  "But we're always
glad to see you."
</p>

<p>
Gardiner doubted that.  But Smith was always
civil to newspaper men.  He hadn't Gardiner
bought, as he had the police, and he knew that
a true column and a bit on his doings might
bring down an avalanche any day.
</p>

<p>
"And here is Mr. Smith," said Billy.
</p>

<p>
"How are you makin' it?" asked Smith,
"and what'll you drink?"
</p>

<p>
But Gardiner was not drinking.  It was so
notoriously unhealthy to drink at Shanghai's
place that few sober men were reckless enough
to take a cocktail there.
</p>

<p>
"How are you off for men?" asked
Gardiner.  "Is business good?"
</p>

<p>
Smith shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Men?  There are too many of 'em!  Now
hell ain't fuller of devils, Mr. Gardiner, than
what San Francisco is of sailors, and you know
as well as me that with sailormen a drug in the
market, I don't come out on top."
</p>

<p>
"To be sure," said Gardiner, "but I was
thinking, as I came along, that you might get
a ship for a young friend of mine."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be glad to do anythin' for any friend
of yours," said Smith, "but as I'm tellin' you,
'tis as easy to be President of the United States
as to do business with the streets full of men
that lets on to be sailors.  What kind of a
job is your friend lookin' for?"
</p>

<p>
Gardiner laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I want him to go a voyage before the mast.
It will do him good."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Smith quickly, "what's the
game?  But whatever it is with you, I'm on!
Say it and mean it!&mdash;that's me."
</p>

<p>
Gardiner edged him up to the quiet end of
the verandah.
</p>

<p>
"Smith, can you hold your tongue and earn
a thousand dollars?"
</p>

<p>
"Can I do what?" asked Smith.  "Look
here, so help me, I'd cut my tongue out for a
thousand.  I tell you, things are tough.  What's
the game?"
</p>

<p>
And Gardiner, after looking round, whispered
in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"Whew!" whistled Smith; "you don't mean
it.  Young Sibley Gawthrop!  Holy sailor,
I'd rather not touch him.  His father is a power
in the land."
</p>

<p>
Gardiner shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well, there are others.  And in
any case, who need know you took a hand in
it?  Now, will you or won't you?  Yes or no,
or I quit right here."
</p>

<p>
"You don't quit.  I'll do it," said Smith.
"I'll do it for you, C.O.D."
</p>

<p>
It can be judged how much he did it for
Gardiner when C.O.D. is translated "Cash on
Delivery."
</p>

<p>
"Right!" said Gardiner, "and pick him a nice
easy ship.  A good old English limejuicer will
be the thing.  I want him to go to Europe."
</p>

<p>
He went up town, and curiously enough found
himself having supper in the swagger restaurant
of the city at the next table to Hunt's victim.
</p>

<p>
"Gawthrop, I want to have a talk with you
on very special business," he said.  "Can you
spare me half an hour to-morrow morning if
I call on you?"
</p>

<p>
And when they parted next morning, after
their talk on "very special business," Sibley
Gawthrop was in a high state of excitement.
</p>

<p>
"If I can only get that Hunt out of the way
for three months, I believe I can work the racket
with her.  But what I can't understand is
Gardiner's notion that he has any chance.  I
suppose that's what he meant by keeping on
saying, 'Don't think I do this for you.  I'm
not in it for friendship or for my health.  I'll
do you if I can.'  Poor beggar, he hasn't the
least show.  Oh, but isn't this a game!  To
think of old Hunt turning up in the London
Docks!"
</p>

<p>
He actually drove along the water-front that
morning in order to gloat over the ships in the
harbour, and when he saw men working up
aloft he burst into laughter.  The notion was
splendid, whatever motive Gardiner had in
putting him up to it.  It was odd that he had
never taken any interest in the seafaring trade
of the city before.  Gawthrop eyed the very
loafers on the wharves with new feelings.
Though he did not know it, he saw Shanghai
Smith and his runner Billy at the bottom of
Spear Street.
</p>

<p>
"Jehoshaphat," said Smith, "now this is a
queer coincī-dence.  Billy, that's the young
feller I've been telling you about.  See him?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather," growled Bill.  "When do you
want him shipped, and how am I to get him?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you when it's fixed up," said Smith.
"I've got to see the chap that's runnin' the
show."
</p>

<p>
"There'll be a holy row on about it,"
grunted Bill.  "It ain't exackly legitimate
business, Mr. Smith.  It's all mighty well doin'
what I know.  I can get a crew out of a ship
in the bay with any man; but shanghain'
sons of millionaires&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're a forsaken fool," said Smith.  "If
you do it neatly, who's to know till he comes
back?  And who knows then you or I done
it?  And ain't I reckonin' to allow you a
bonus of ten dollars extra?  With times as
they is now, ten dollars is ten dollars, lemme
tell you.  And you've taken to growlin' lately
in a way I'm not goin' to stand, Bill.  I don't
want any slack-jaw from you, so there."
</p>

<p>
"Who's givin' any slack-jaw?" expostulated
the runner.  "I suppose a man can hev an
opinion?"
</p>

<p>
"And he can keep it till called for, too,"
said his boss.  "I can lick you any time."
</p>

<p>
And Bill growled, "Who says you can't?
Would I be workin' for you if you couldn't?"  The
inference was not exactly obvious.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon Gardiner came down again to
the Barbary Coast, and had another talk with
Shanghai Smith.
</p>

<p>
"What, another of 'em?" asked Shanghai.
"I say, Mr. Gardiner, this is a bit thick!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's two thousand dollars thick," said
Gardiner; "if you could only ship a whole
crew on such terms, you might retire and go in
for politics."
</p>

<p>
"And who's the man this time?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Jack Hunt."
</p>

<p>
"Him as is payin' for Gawthrop?"
</p>

<p>
Gardiner nodded.
</p>

<p>
"And who's payin' for Hunt?"
</p>

<p>
Gardiner took him by the greasy lapel of his
coat.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you&mdash;it's Gawthrop!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Gardiner, who was doing the dramatic
criticism for the <i>Chronicle</i> that night, saw
Gawthrop and Hunt in Miss Atherton's box
at the Opera House.  They appeared to be on
very good terms, and were both in an excellent
humour.  For all that he had planned, George
Gardiner was in no great good temper when he
imagined that Edith showed more favour to
Sibley than to his rival.
</p>

<p>
"He's not a bad sort, but he's not the sort to
marry a girl like that," said Gardiner; "if she
only knew the life he has led, she'd give him
the mitten right off.  And I could let her know.
It's doing him a favour to send him to sea.
And as for Hunt, he's really mean.  Life won't
be all pie to him as he's laid it out to be.
She'll think they've shied off, and will be mad,
and more ready to listen to a man who has
loved her for years, as she knows.  If she'd only
take me while I'm poor, I'd be the proudest
man in California.  And wouldn't it make all
California sick!"
</p>

<p>
Though he did not know it, both Gawthrop
and Hunt played into his hands.  Each was
quite convinced that he was the favoured lover,
and as they both had a secret they used it when
they got a chance.
</p>

<p>
"Gawthrop is a very nice fellow," said Jack
Hunt condescendingly; "but he never knows
his own mind, Miss Atherton.  I should
never be surprised to hear he had gone to
Europe.  He's fond of travel, and very, very
inconstant."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed," said Edith.  She had found him
fairly persevering.  It was strange when Hunt
was called outside for a few minutes that
Gawthrop, who this night had shown no
jealousy, threw out a dark hint that Hunt was
no true Californian.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't be in the least surprised to hear
he had gone to Europe," he said.  "He's very
flighty.  I suppose that is the reason he didn't
marry while he was young."
</p>

<p>
Hunt was thirty, and his rival was twenty-six.
</p>

<p>
"And don't you want to see Europe?"
asked Edith, who wondered what was in the wind.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, some day, but not alone," answered
Sibley.  "I shall never go without a companion."
</p>

<p>
"You should go with Jack Hunt," said
Edith mischievously.  "I certainly wonder none
of you travel more.  Now, Mr. Gardiner down
there has been all over the world."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, poor Gardiner!" said Sibley.  "How
is it so clever and good-natured a man should
be doing what he is?"
</p>

<p>
And much to Sibley's astonishment, Edith
Atherton turned on him with an odd question.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;and what are you doing?"
</p>

<p>
Perhaps if Gardiner had heard her ask that
question, he might have considered that
Shanghai Smith need not intervene after all.
</p>

<p>
But Smith did intervene that night.
</p>

<p>
When Gawthrop left the theatre he went
straight down Market Street to the water-front,
and found his way to Shanghai Smith's without
any difficulty.  He had plenty of pluck, and
plenty of ignorance of the real conditions of life
in San Francisco.  What he heard and what he
read about the matter did not touch him; he
lived in security in quite another world from
the scoundrels at the bottom of Clay Street
and the toughs of the "Coast."  Life there was
a theatrical representation.  He sat in the stalls
and said, "Poor devils, do they really live that
way?"  He was Sibley Gawthrop, the son of
a big man: he was a power himself: he had
no fear, and went into the trap smiling.  If he
carried in his hip pocket what Westerners call
a "gun," it was on account of Western
traditions.  He showed no caution, though he
walked whistling in the middle of the road.
He had no chance to use any weapon, and he
never saw Smith.  He never even saw Billy,
Smith's runner, till Billy sand-bagged him on
the back of the head.  For Smith was not to be
found at his house.  He was with Gardiner, and
they were both waiting till they heard from the
runner that Gawthrop was safely disposed of.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't goin' to show in it," said Smith,
"and why should I?  The <i>Hampshire</i> is short
of two hands as I shipped in her myself.  They
don't go aboard when they should, and they
turns up drunk at my house, and Billy puts
them on board.  Can I help it if he puts the
wrong ones on her?  Of course I cayn't.  And
if Billy finds the cash agreed on on 'em and
hands it to me, why, I'll keep it till it's claimed
by the owners of it!"
</p>

<p>
He winked his eye at Gardiner, and the
journalist burst into laughter.
</p>

<p>
"They'll not touch me," he said, "and if
they do, I shall either have the laugh on them
or shan't care."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, there was a message sent up
from the street.  A boy wanted to see Mr. Gardiner.
</p>

<p>
"A printer's devil, of course," said Gardiner.
But he knew the word came from Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Billy, Mr. Smith's runner, gimme a quarter
to run up to you, sir, and say it's all right,"
said the young hoodlum.  "And <i>he</i> said you
was to gimme another quarter."
</p>

<p>
Billy had said nothing of the kind, but the
boy got it all the same.
</p>

<p>
And half an hour later Jack Hunt interviewed
Billy the runner in about the same place in
the dark road that Gawthrop had met him.
The runner went through his pockets eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Two thousand in the one night," said Billy.
"Oh, ain't Smith doin' well?  And two first-class
guns as belongs to me.  I'll shove 'em on
board the <i>Hampshire</i> bright and early.  Oh, I
done it clean and neat."
</p>

<p>
He had great professional pride, and when
he came alongside the <i>Hampshire</i> at four o'clock
in the morning, and found all hands getting up
the anchor, he felt that the thing was going to
finish itself without a hitch.
</p>

<p>
"Once at sea and the job's complete.  Hallo,
there, send down a whip into the boat," he
cried.  "I've got them two as skipped.  And
good men, too, when they're sober."
</p>

<p>
He heard the first mate bellow:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Jones, get these swine on board quick.
Drunk, are they?  We'll sober 'em.  Up aloft
and loose the topsails."
</p>

<p>
And the two lights of San Francisco society
were carried into the foc'sle.
</p>

<p>
"Blimy, but I'd give sumfink to be as blind
speechless as this," said one cockney, "and there
ain't no chance of it till we gets to London."
</p>

<p>
But the mate was roaring overhead.  They
dropped Hunt and Gawthrop into two empty
bunks and went on deck.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you turn those men to?" asked
the chief mate, Mr. Ladd, of Jones.  And
Jones went into the foc'sle and punched both
of these gentlemen in the ribs.
</p>

<p>
"Wake up, you drunken galoots," said Jones.
</p>

<p>
In answer they both sighed and snored, and
turned peaceably to rest.  Jones, who knew
a bit, unhooked the lamp from the sweating
beam overhead, and lifting Hunt's eyelid with
his thumb, saw that the man's pupil was
down to a pin-point.  It was the same with
Gawthrop.
</p>

<p>
"Hocussed, of course," he said.  And he
reported aft that not even putting them under
the hose would wake them for some hours.
</p>

<p>
"Confound all California and its manners
and customs," said Ladd.
</p>

<p>
But the manners and customs of Shanghai
Smith at any rate saved Hunt and Gawthrop
from eight hours of the finest education in the
world.  It was noon, and the <i>Hampshire's</i>
crowd was at dinner when Gawthrop showed
signs of animation.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, humph!" said Gawthrop, and without
opening his eyes he reached out and pressed
the head of a small bolt with his thumb.
</p>

<p>
"What's the josser doin' of?" asked Tom,
the cockney who had sighed over the fact that
there was no chance of getting intoxicated until
they reached London.
</p>

<p>
"Johnson, give me some tea," said Gawthrop.
He believed that his man had answered the
electric bell.  But there was a Johnson, or
more properly a Johanssen, among the crew.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Dutchy, give him some tea."
</p>

<p>
Gawthrop opened his eyes and yawned.  He
shut his eyes again, but did not shut his mouth
in time to prevent Bill Yardley, who was the
joker of the crowd, dropping a piece of soaked
biscuit into it.  Gawthrop spluttered, coughed
violently, and sat up.  As he did so he of
course hit his head a smart crack on the deck
above him.  He sat up again on his elbow,
and stared about him stupidly.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere, come out, matey, and 'ave yer grub,"
cried the kindly crew with one voice.
</p>

<p>
"You've 'ad a rare good caulk," said Tom
encouragingly.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, eh, what?" asked Gawthrop.  He
blinked at the men, and with a fallen jaw
wagged his head from side to side.
</p>

<p>
"Where am I?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"On board the <i>'Ampshire</i>, sonny," said Tom.
"Come, show a leg!"
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" said Gawthrop, and he rolled a
dry tongue against his teeth.  "Am I asleep?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll lay odds you won't be in ten minutes,"
said Tom.  "What's the game you're playin'?"
</p>

<p>
Gawthrop stared at him and rolled his eyes
round the foc'sle.  He saw fifteen grinning
faces in the light from the scuttle above.
Outside the open foc'sle door he beheld the
foremast, with its rail and the gear coiled on
the pins.
</p>

<p>
"It's a ship," said Gawthrop, "it's obviously
a ship!"
</p>

<p>
The men looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
"D'ye think he's a greenhorn?"
</p>

<p>
"Hocussed!"
</p>

<p>
"Shanghaied!"
</p>

<p>
The word "Shanghai" fetched Gawthrop
clean out of his dream.
</p>

<p>
It hit him fair and square, and though
it half-stunned him, it woke him, all the same.
</p>

<p>
"Where am I?"
</p>

<p>
"In the <i>Hampshire</i> and at sea," said all
hands eagerly.  They saw what had happened
quicker than he did.  For reasons which he
did not yet understand they believed him a
seaman, but they saw he had been shipped
against his will.
</p>

<p>
"D'ye think it was Shanghai Smith as
done it?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said Gawthrop.  "Why, where's Hunt?"
</p>

<p>
"D'ye mean your mate as come aboard wid
you?" asked Tom.  "There 'e is, 'ard and
fast asleep.  Wake 'im up, chaps: I say, 'ere's
a game."
</p>

<p>
Gawthrop put a leg out and dropped on deck
just as Tom got Hunt by the hair and gave
it a yank that nearly raised his scalp, but did
not wake him.
</p>

<p>
"Is this 'im?"
</p>

<p>
In the half-light Gawthrop saw a face which
was the colour of dark mahogany, and did not
recognise his rival.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said.  He did not know that
Billy, with a professional ardour that did him
credit, had coloured Hunt and himself with
walnut juice on their faces and hands till they
appeared to have been tanned the three skins deep.
</p>

<p>
And just as Gawthrop denied that he knew
Hunt, the boson's whistle blew.
</p>

<p>
"You'd best come on deck.  They're goin'
to pick the watches," said Tom.  And Gawthrop,
still in a maze, followed the rest.  When the
fresh air blew on him, his mind cleared as
suddenly as if a fog had rolled up.
</p>

<p>
"By the Lord, I've been done," he said,
and he knew it was Gardiner who had done
him.  "All right," he said, "I'll get even.
The captain must put back.  I'll pay him to
do it."
</p>

<p>
His knowledge of the sea was limited.
Though he was the citizen of a republic, he
had been accustomed to deference.  That was
when he was Sibley Gawthrop.  He was now
a nameless man in dungaree trousers and a
blue shirt, in a ship bound for London with
a fine fair wind.  He walked aft with the
defiant yet shamed air of a man who has been
at a fancy ball and finds himself surprised by
daylight.
</p>

<p>
"I want to see the captain," he said to the
first man whom he met aft.  It happened to
be Jones, the second "greaser."
</p>

<p>
"That's him on the poop," said Jones,
staring at him; "take a good look at him, you
drunken swab.  Why the blue blazes didn't
you come on board before?"
</p>

<p>
"My good fellow," said Gawthrop haughtily,
"there has been a mistake.  I must be put
on shore immediately."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Jones, "oh, indeed!  There
has been a fatal error, has there?  And I'm
your good fellow, am I?  Take that, you
swine."
</p>

<p>
And what Gawthrop took caused him to sit
down very suddenly on a hard teak deck.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Mr. Jones?" asked
the captain, coming to the break of the poop.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, sir, nothing," said Jones, foaming
at the mouth, "only this ratty hoodlum isn't
sober yet.  I'll have him in my watch if
Mr. Ladd hasn't any fancy for him."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," said Gawthrop, still in a sitting
position, "I'm not a sailor, and have been
put on board against my will.  My name's
Gawthrop&mdash;Sibley Gawthrop of Menlo Park.
I'm well known in San Francisco."
</p>

<p>
"Dry up!" said Jones; "known to the
police, I should say.  And your name's either
Fisher or Bates.  And where's that other josser?
I'll soon see if he's one of the same sort."
</p>

<p>
He shot forward, and was presently seen
emerging from the foc'sle holding the astounded
Hunt by the nape of the neck.  He ran him
aft and discharged him like a catapult right
among the men.  He fell down alongside
Gawthrop.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones," said the skipper
mildly.  But if he was going to remonstrate
with Jones on his American methods, the two
hands who had caused the fuss put him off.
For Hunt and Gawthrop, on recognising each
other, as they did now in spite of their high
colouring, lost no time in speech, but went
for each other without a word.  They locked
together and rolled headlong into the starboard
scuppers; for though the ship was on an
even keel with a fine northerly breeze, the deck
had a big camber to it.  Then Captain Singleton
lost all his mildness at this outrageous insult
to his high authority.
</p>

<p>
"Pull them apart," he roared, as Jones dived
for Gawthrop's ankle, and two of the crew
got Hunt by the legs.  "What the devil does
this mean?"
</p>

<p>
"It means he's had me shanghaied," said
Hunt.  "I know it."
</p>

<p>
"And you&mdash;oh, I'll kill you," spluttered
Gawthrop.
</p>

<p>
"Send them both up here," said the captain.
He stared at them like a fury when they stood
before him.  No two harder looking cases ever
had an interview with a skipper, for Gawthrop
was bleeding from the nose, and Hunt had
lost all his shirt but the neck-band.  They
glared at each other, and Jones stood between
them ready.
</p>

<p>
"Now then," said Singleton, "before I put
you in irons I'd like to know what you mean
by daring&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
It was paralysing to both Gawthrop and
Hunt to be looked at as the captain looked
at them.  They felt like the scum of the
earth.
</p>

<p>
"It's a mistake, a dreadful mistake," said
Hunt; "if you will put me ashore, I'll give
you five thousand dollars."
</p>

<p>
And the eager crowd on the main-deck
sniggered.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, he's very big in drink, ain't 'e?"
said Tom.
</p>

<p>
The skipper frowned, and shook his fist
right against Hunt's face.
</p>

<p>
"You hound, don't joke with me.  What's
this man's name, Mr. Jones?"
</p>

<p>
"It's either Bates or Fisher," said Jones.
</p>

<p>
"No, my name's Hunt," cried Hunt.  And
one of the men on deck, an insinuating beggar
who liked to curry favour with the powers,
cried:
</p>

<p>
"His name's Fisher, sir.  I've seed him
often about the front."
</p>

<p>
"It's not, it's not," said Hunt furiously.
"I'm a man well known in San Francisco."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!" said Jones; "the other joskin
said that."
</p>

<p>
"I won't shut up," roared Hunt, quite losing
his temper.  "I warn you all to put me ashore,
or I'll ruin the lot of you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said the captain, "indeed, well, we'll
see.  Mr. Jones, you can have the one there&mdash;Bates,
I think.  Mr. Ladd, look after this
sailorman with the five thousand dollars.  Now
if there's another word comes out of either of
you, or if you start fighting again and I hear
of it, I'll make the pair of you wish you'd died
before you saw me."
</p>

<p>
And Jones shoved both of them down on the
main-deck.  The two unfortunates recognised
that their only chance, and that the faintest,
lay in speaking together.
</p>

<p>
"But we're neither of us sailors, sir," they
said piteously.
</p>

<p>
"This is where we manufacture sailors," said
Captain Singleton, who was not without humour.
"Mr. Jones, Mr. Ladd, you hear that I hope
they won't be able to say as much for
themselves this day three months."
</p>

<p>
And the crew laughed, as in duty bound.
But Hunt and Gawthrop did not laugh.
</p>

<p>
"D'ye think there's any truth in what those
two men said?" asked Captain Singleton of
his mate.
</p>

<p>
"Likely enough, sir," replied Ladd.  "Aren't
we out of San Francisco?"
</p>

<p>
"I certainly don't seem to remember their
faces," said the skipper, "but they'll have to do.
Make what you can of them.  If it's any ways
true, it's no good telling them we think so."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not, sir," said Ladd.  "But what's
their remedy?"
</p>

<p>
He knew perfectly well that there was no
practical remedy against the ship.  And Hunt
and Gawthrop were well aware they had none
against their friend Shanghai Smith, or against
Gardiner.
</p>

<p>
They had no chance of speaking to each
other till the second dog-watch, and then only in
the presence of the whole crowd, who were very
anxious to get to the bottom of the mystery.
</p>

<p>
"They ain't sailormen, not they," growled
the oldest man on board, who came from Brook
Street, Shadwell, and was known as "Shadwell,"
though his real name was Shaw, "and a nice
thing for hus.  Two less to take the wheel.  I
calls it a bally shime."
</p>

<p>
He looked at Hunt with an air of unutterable
contempt, and sniffed every time the man
spoke.  Gawthrop, who was younger and more
elastic, sat on the other side of the foc'sle, and
presently addressed Hunt.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose we must make the best of it, Hunt."
</p>

<p>
"Don't speak to me, sir," said Hunt, and
the crew roared.
</p>

<p>
"Tell us 'ow it 'appened, do," said Tom.
"Oh, ain't your friend 'aughty?  Tell us, 'as
'e got that five thousand dollars?"
</p>

<p>
"Not on him," replied Gawthrop.
</p>

<p>
"Look 'ere," said Tom, "if you'll tell us
the troof, I'll stand you a drop of rum.  I've a
nip left.  And this is a teetotal ship, this is."
</p>

<p>
He could not conceive any man refusing
such a bribe.  And Gawthrop, in spite of
everything, could hardly help laughing at Hunt's
face.  He took the rum partly to have an
excuse for telling the story.  It was the wisest
thing to be friends with every one, and after
all, if he was out of the running for a time, so
was Hunt.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Gawthrop, "I and my cheerful
friend over there are very great friends indeed.
But I wanted him out of San Francisco for a
time, for reasons.  And I got Shanghai Smith
to arrange it."
</p>

<p>
"<i>We</i> know him," said the crowd eagerly.
"Oh yes, we know him!"
</p>

<p>
"I stayed in 'is 'ouse."
</p>

<p>
"So did I."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up and let him tell us."
</p>

<p>
And Hunt by now was all alone on the starboard
side.  Even old Shadwell came across to
hear the yarn.
</p>

<p>
"Another friend of mine suggested it," said
Gawthrop, "and fixed it up for me."
</p>

<p>
  That was Gardiner," said Hunt.<br />
</p>

<p>
"It was," said Gawthrop, "and I paid a
thousand dollars to have Mr. Hunt put here."
</p>

<p>
"That's what <i>I</i> paid to have you put here,"
said Hunt.  "A friend of mine put me up
to it."
</p>

<p>
"That was Gardiner," said Gawthrop.
</p>

<p>
"It was," said Hunt.
</p>

<p>
"And that's why we're both here," said
Gawthrop, and his aspect was at once so melancholy
and so comic that all hands shrieked with
laughter.  Old Shadwell creaked like the cheep
of a block.
</p>

<p>
"But what'd this hyer Gardiner to do with
the show?" asked the only American in the
crew.  "It looks like as if he played the pair
of you for suckers."
</p>

<p>
"You hear that, Hunt?"
</p>

<p>
"I hear," said Hunt sulkily.  "Wait till I
see him."
</p>

<p>
"You ain't told us hall," said Shadwell, with
a gloomy air of suspicion.  "I knows somethin'
of life, and somethin' about women; and
there was a woman in this."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Shadwell is right," said Gawthrop.
</p>

<p>
"I was to have taken her for a drive this
morning," said Hunt; "and a pretty sort of
a man I shall look, not turning up."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," said Gawthrop.  "I was to
have taken her out this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Old Shadwell nodded gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"What 'ave I often told you about 'em,
boys!" he said.  "This proves it.  A woman's
like a cat with nine lives, and nine sorts of
dispositions, and if she don't satisfy 'em with
nine sort of man fool she ain't happy.  I've
know them as nine wouldn't satisfy.  And
they're all the same; there's different nations
of men, but women is all one nation.  You
can bet your boots, you two fellers, that your
girl is out with some one else.  This here v'yge
will do you good if it rams that into you."
</p>

<p>
He turned to the others.
</p>

<p>
"D'ye believe what this young feller has
told you?"
</p>

<p>
They said they did.  Shadwell turned again
to Gawthrop.
</p>

<p>
"It's 'ard lines on men as is sailormen,
and ships so short-'anded as they always is
with greedy owners, to 'ave ship-mates as
can't do their work.  But you look bright,
young feller, and if you skips quick and
does your best, there ain't no reason as you
shouldn't be some kind of use in the world
before we're off the Horn.  And I say the
same to you over there."
</p>

<p>
"Go to the devil," replied Hunt sulkily.
</p>

<p>
"Sailormen don't go there.  <i>They</i> goes to
Fidler's Green," said Shadwell.  "And mark
me!  Put the girl out of your minds.  This
was a put-up job, and <i>she</i> was in it.  She'll
marry this here Gardiner!"
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't a cent," said Gawthrop contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
"It don't follow," said Shadwell stubbornly,
"that because woman is wicked by nature
they ain't silly by choice.  I tell you Gardiner
'as gone to wind'ard of you!  He's laughin'
this very minute!"
</p>

<p>
And so he was.  But Edith Atherton was
by no means amused at the sudden disappearance
of the two men who were supposed
to stand highest in her favour.  Whether she
cared much or little for either of them, or
not, it was unpleasant to have them fail to
keep their appointments, and to leave San
Francisco without a word of explanation.  Her
first and very natural impulse was to let every
one infer that she had rejected both of them.
But when old Mr. Gawthrop called on her
during the second day she had to own that
she understood the mystery as little as the
newspapers did.  And all the papers were very
keen on any scent.
</p>

<p>
"But, Mr. Gawthrop, they both said something
that I could not understand.  Mr. Hunt
said that he was sure that your son would
soon go to Europe, and not ten minutes
after Sibley said the same of Mr. Hunt."
</p>

<p>
The explanation seemed easy to the old
man.  Both of them imagined that his rejected
rival would travel.  The rest must be a
coincidence.  He went away to the police, and
the police invented many hypotheses.  They
were learned in the matter of disappearances
in San Francisco.  But none of the hypotheses
seemed to fit.  Both the young men were
wealthy, and it seemed certain that one or
the other of them was bound to succeed with
the lady in question.  Nevertheless, old
Gawthrop learnt some things about his son which
surprised him.
</p>

<p>
There was one newspaper which suggested
that they might have been shanghaied.  It was
the <i>Chronicle</i>, on which Gardiner worked.  For
though he had made up his mind to do very
little more work on any paper, he was loyal
to his flag so long as he hoisted it, and meant
that the <i>Chronicle</i> should be able to sail in
at the last and say, "We told you so."  And
when every one else on the paper failed in
getting an interview with Miss Atherton, he
volunteered to try.
</p>

<p>
"You must understand, however," he said
to his editor, "that even if I see her I don't
promise to write anything about it.  You
see, I knew her a little when she was in New
York two years ago, and though I'm not in
the gilt-edged crowd she adorns here, I owe
her something."
</p>

<p>
And Edith Atherton saw him, although she
did consider a man on a newspaper little, if
anything, higher than a deck-hand in a Bay
ferry-boat.  She had never understood what
he was doing in California at all.  He went
to interview her, and she interviewed him.
</p>

<p>
"I'm here as a man from the <i>Chronicle</i>, Miss
Atherton," said Gardiner.  He spoke almost
timidly.  It was the first time he had ever
been alone with her.
</p>

<p>
"You are not here as a man from the
<i>Chronicle</i>" said Edith.
</p>

<p>
"You mean&mdash;&mdash;?" said Gardiner eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I mean that," said Edith&mdash;"just that.  You
are here as the Mr. Gardiner I met in New
York."
</p>

<p>
Gardiner's eyes sparkled.  He looked at her,
smiled, and then laughed.
</p>

<p>
"But mayn't I ask you anything about
the&mdash;mystery?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see what it has to do with me,"
replied Edith.  "But I see your paper says
they have been shanghaied?  Tell me what
that means."
</p>

<p>
He explained: no man knew better.
</p>

<p>
"You mean they have gone to sea as common
sailors?" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"That is the theory of the <i>Chronicle</i>" said
Gardiner drily.  "If we are right, it will do
them both good."
</p>

<p>
"I'm rather sorry for Sibley Gawthrop,"
she said; but Gardiner was not so young
as to be discouraged by her sympathy for
Sibley.
</p>

<p>
"May I be sorry for him too?" asked
Gardiner, boldly.
</p>

<p>
Edith Atherton stared at him and dropped
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"How is your father?" she asked irrelevantly.
"He was a very nice old man."
</p>

<p>
"So he is," replied Gardiner, "the only
trouble was that he believed he owned me.
He came from the South, and was one of the
few Southerners, who, on losing their slaves,
played their own game on the men from the
North.  He and I quarrelled about a subject in
which I considered he had no right to interfere."
</p>

<p>
There were no obvious implications in the
way he spoke, and Edith Atherton saw none.
</p>

<p>
"What was that?" she asked, innocently enough.
</p>

<p>
"His view was that I shouldn't marry until
he let me.  I wanted to marry you."
</p>

<p>
Edith gasped a little and took hold of her
chair as she bent forward.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Mr. Gardiner."
</p>

<p>
"And I still want to, Miss Atherton.  And
as the lady whom he wished me to marry was
married a month ago, I think he will forgive
me, if I ask him.  It was always understood,
even when we parted, that he would reinstate
me as his partner if I succeeded for myself."
</p>

<p>
"And have you succeeded?" asked Edith
with bent head.
</p>

<p>
Gardiner rose from his chair and went
towards her.
</p>

<p>
"That is for you to say," he cried.
</p>

<p>
And when he returned to the office he
handed in no more than a paragraph.  It was
considered in some quarters an adequate
explanation of the disappearance of Hunt and
Gawthrop.  Yet it was not adequate for Edith.
It was only when she became Mrs. Gardiner,
and they were on their way East, that her
husband told her the truth.
</p>

<p>
"I'm really very sorry now," said Gardiner.
"Nevertheless, it will do them lots of good.
They required it.  You never really liked
either of them, Edith?"
</p>

<p>
"No-o, not that way," said his wife.  But
she said to herself, "Next day I should have
accepted Mr. Gawthrop!"
</p>

<p>
They ran into Laramie Junction, that
horrible centre of sage-brush and alkali.  A
bitter wind drove dust against the windows of
their car.
</p>

<p>
"It's a ghastly prospect," said Gardiner, as
he looked out on the prairie.
</p>

<p>
"It would have been," replied his wife absently.
</p>

<p>
"It would have been?" asked her husband
in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"I mean it is, of course," said Edith hastily.

<h3>
THE MAN FROM ABO
</h3>

<p>
William, or, as he was usually called,
Bill, Noyes, was a citizen of the
United States, and, like most citizens of that
part of the Western Continent, he was
accustomed to do as he "darned pleased."  But
besides being an American citizen, he was an
American shipmaster, and such are accustomed
to having their own way and giving no one
else a chance.  He explained this to the crowd
in the <i>State of Oregon</i>, bound from San Francisco
to Bordeaux, with wine which was going to be
converted into claret.  For this was some time
ago, before the wine-growers there had it all
their own way in the French Republic.
</p>

<p>
"You're dogs, and I'm the man with the
whip.  You're hogs, and I'm your driver.  I'm
boss, and captain, and governor, and congress,
and the senate, and the president, and don't any
of you forget it!  If I hadn't been brought
up religious I'd go a step farther still.  Let
me hear a growl out of you, and I'll make you
wish you were in hell.  Do your duty, and
I'll make this ship paradise.  It shall be as
sweet to you as a full roost of chickens to a
buck nigger on a dark night.  I'm a good
man, I am, and I know it.  You'll know it,
too.  I'll see to that.  Now then, Mr. Bragg,
start them to.  D'ye see that damned
Dutchman?  He looks as if he didn't
understand 'United States.'  Jolt him on the
jaw for me!"
</p>

<p>
And the unfortunate Dutchman, who was
really a Finn from Abo, got a crack with a
closed fist that made him see more stars than
even the American flag of liberty can boast.
</p>

<p>
"What for?  I done nuttin'," he yelled,
as he put his hand to his head; but never
another man opened his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Say another word," said Bragg, "and I'll
ram a belaying-pin crossways down your throat,"
and this was the beginning.
</p>

<p>
"Very good indeed," said Noyes.  "Now
every one understands, Mr. Bragg, and no one
can say everything warn't explained to them
clearly.  Work the drink out of 'em.  I'm
for a holy, healthy, happy crew."
</p>

<p>
And Noyes went below for a drink.  He
was, as he often said, a sober man.
</p>

<p>
"One tot every time the bell strikes, and
two at eight-bells, and as a man can't sleep
and drink, I take what I should take before
I turn in."
</p>

<p>
But none of the men for'ard got as much
as a teaspoonful even after shortening sail, or
on Saturday nights.
</p>

<p>
"We've struck it rich," said the crowd,
when they got together in the second
dog-watch.  "We've struck it rich.  There's no
fatal error about that.  You can see it with
half an eye a mile off.  The skipper's a holy
terror!"
</p>

<p>
"Ya! ya! we've got to yoomp!" said a
real Dutchman, and he was put in the place
proper to a Dutchman at once.
</p>

<p>
"Speak when you are spoken to," said the
English and American seamen all at once.
"These Dutchmen are getting past a joke,
bullies."
</p>

<p>
"So they are," said old Mackenzie, a shellback
of the briniest description.  "When I
was a boy, if one of them opened his mouth
too wide we used to put something in it."
</p>

<p>
"What did you put in?" asked the eager
Anglo-Saxons.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anything as he couldn't eat," said Mac.
"A ball o' twine or a swab.  I remember one
Dutchy as <i>would</i> talk&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But just then the man from Abo came in,
and though the crowd was not really
sympathetic, they asked him how his jaw felt.  It
appeared after all that he understood "United
States" sufficiently well when it was to the
point: that is, when it concerned his duty or
the talk that goes on in a foc'sle.  A word
beyond these limits opened his eyes and shut
his mouth.  He was then like a waiter fresh
from the Continent, who can talk in English
about food, and food only.
</p>

<p>
"Never you mind, Dutchy," said one of his
own watch.  "Mebbe, after all, it'll do you
good.  If Bragg hammers you, we won't."
</p>

<p>
Even such consolation was better than none,
and Dutchy was truly grateful.  The lot of a
"Dutchman" at sea is not always beer and
skittles.  But even an Anglo-American crowd
can have sympathy when they are like to want
it themselves.  They certainly found that Billy
Noyes's notion of a paradise made Tophet look
cool, even as depicted to a sad and sober sailor
in a waterside Bethel.  They wanted Bordeaux
badly, and under the influence of that desire
and the stimulation supplied by the officers
they lost no time in getting there.  And as
they were a fine lot as men go, few of them
came in for actual hammering.  The slowest
got that always, and the man from Abo was
the man to get it.
</p>

<p>
It was marvellous to observe how much he
got and how little it seemed to hurt him.  He
was knocked down once a day and twice on
Sundays.  Even when he got a chance to be
first up aloft he never seemed to know it.
The only way he had of getting down first
was to fall.  And once when he did so without
seriously damaging himself Bragg hammered
him for doing it.
</p>

<p>
"What you're after is to be laid up; I see
that," said Bragg.  "But let me catch you
at it."
</p>

<p>
And Hans shook his head under Bragg's
heavy hand till he forgot he had bruises on him
the size of a soup-plate.
</p>

<p>
"Dutchy's a fair wonder," said the crowd,
rejoicing in their own freedom; "he's taking
the whack of all us and never turns a hair.
We'll have to get up a subscription for him.
Ain't he just tough?  Say, Dutchy, suppose you
and Bragg or you and the old man was to have
a fair set-to, d'ye think you could down either
of 'em?"
</p>

<p>
"Ya," said Hans from Abo very soberly,
"neider of 'em can't hurt me mooch."
</p>

<p>
"He's made of teak," said the admiring
crowd.  "Now, there ain't one of us wouldn't
be bunged up if we'd been hit about like him,
and he ain't got a mark."
</p>

<p>
"It reminds me of a Chinky I fo't once,"
said one of the men.  "I knocked him down
seven times, and then two other chaps chucked
him out.  And next morning he was as cheerful
as you please and never fazed; not a mark to
him.  I give him ten cents for a drink to let
me look at him close.  Dutchy's just such
another, he's a real tough, so he is."
</p>

<p>
Hans's marvellous capacity for being
hammered was soon noted aft.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you take a pillow to him?"
said Noyes, with a sneer.  "To see you hit him,
Bragg, makes me tired, and you used to be
a hard man, too."
</p>

<p>
The mate was injured in his tenderest point.
</p>

<p>
"I done my best," he said suddenly.  "I
carn't help it if the swine is made of
injy-rubber.  I pretty near skinned my knuckles
on him yesterday, and he's as fresh as paint
to-day.  Try him yourself, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I hired you," retorted Noyes; "but if I
do get at him you'll see something fly."
</p>

<p>
They were well to the nor'ard and eastward
of the Horn before Noyes happened to try,
and it was blowing a snorter from the
south-west.  As the men came down on the poop
after stowing the lower mizzen-topsail, Hans,
having gum-boots on, slipped and fell against
the skipper.  The next moment Hans was on
his back and Noyes had his knuckles to his
own mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!" said Noyes, with a face like
a comic door-knocker or a Japanese grotesque,
and he turned about and went below.
</p>

<p>
"It serves him right," said Hans.  "Oh,
no, I ain't hurt.  It is nuttin'."
</p>

<p>
And though he showed nothing, not even a
slight puffiness on his high cheek-bone, the
skipper wore a mitten on his right hand for
days.  Noyes even conceived a certain respect
for the Finn.
</p>

<p>
"I thought I'd hit a bollard," he said.  "I
ought to have hit him on the jaw, or where he
keeps his wind."
</p>

<p>
By dint of these object-lessons Hans gradually
got an easier time.  If Bragg ever went for
him he kicked him, and the marks he made, if
he made any, did not show, for Hans came
on board clothed, and never undressed till they
reached the Line in the Atlantic.  There he
took a bath.  As he said, he always made a
point of having some buckets of water thrown
over him every time he crossed the equator
homeward bound; perhaps he thought it kept
him fresh.  But by then Bragg was even tired
of kicking him.  Nothing made him go slower
or faster.  He went at the pace he had been
born to, and he never learnt anything more
than he had known at seventeen.  If there is
any truth in the transmigration of souls, Hans
must have been a tortoise and was destined to
"jump up" again as a sloth.  But once, after a
long slow month of provocation, he hit the real
Dutchman from Amsterdam, and that native of
Holland "went to sleep" for two hours.
</p>

<p>
"He's the on'y Dutchman I ever had any
real respect for," said the crowd each for
himself.  But of course he was a Finn, and, as
every one knows, a Finn triumphs over his
disabilities as a Dutchman by virtue of strange gifts.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't believe none of that jaw about
Finns and witchcraft," said old Mackenzie,
"but I own there's always somethin' strange
about a Finn.  Now, all Hans's nature seems to
'ave run to 'ardness.  What a saddle 'is skin
would make!"  For Mac had spent two
years in the Australian bush, and was never
tired of relating his strange experiences on
horseback.
</p>

<p>
And presently the <i>State of Oregon</i> began, as
the men said, to smell land.  It was off
Finisterre that Noyes proved the man from
Abo could bleed; for the skipper never forgot
that he had been knocked out in one round
by knocking down a 'Dutchman.'  The thought
rankled, and when Hans was at the wheel
when the wind was light out of the north-east
the skipper's temper, ragged at a contrary wind
when he had made a record passage so far, led
him a little astray.  For, as he often said, "It's
all right marking men when one's bound home
and when they've time to get well bound to
Yewrope, but I like to leave 'em without no
visible sign to say you've larrupped 'em when
I'm bound East."
</p>

<p>
In the United States there is very little
respect for a man who can't take care of
himself, but some Europeans have silly
notions.  It's not uncommon even to find a
consul who doesn't understand that sailors are
no good unless they are in a state of mutiny or
near it.  There is no end to the foolishness of
some consuls, as Captain Noyes often complained
with natural bitterness.  So when, after
he had cursed Hans twice for his steering,
he jammed the brass end of his telescope
right between the man's eyes and cut him
badly, he was quite sorry for it.  You see,
he had almost got to believe that the man
from Abo couldn't be hurt.  But a brass
telescope properly applied makes four neat little
cuts, one on the forehead, one on the bridge of
the nose, and one on each eyebrow, as a little
consideration of the human race and the nature
of a circle will show.  The blood ran down into
Hans's eyes, and Bragg had to walk to the break
of the poop and bellow:
</p>

<p>
"Relieve the wheel!"
</p>

<p>
And two days afterwards the <i>State of Oregon</i>,
owing to a favourable change of wind, lay at
Bordeaux.  As soon as she did, the entire crew
got too much to drink, and not even Noyes
and Bragg could handle them, though the
skipper was, as he had averred at the beginning
of the passage, captain and congress and
president all rolled in one.  The only people
who could handle them were the French police,
and they had their work cut out.  The next
day, as it is the habit of Frenchmen and
Spaniards and the like to let the consuls fix
up all difficulties with foreign crews if they can,
the American Consul was called on to arbitrate
in the matter.  And for the nonce the American
Consul was the English one, for Mr. Schuyler
had gone to Paris on what he described as
business, but what no Puritan would have
called such.  And this is where the man from
Abo came home, as one may say.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Johnson, then British Consul at Bordeaux,
was a fine man with a clear skin, a merry eye,
a knowledge of the world, and a hard fist.  As
a young man he had been amateur champion
of the middle-weights in England, and though
he was now a heavy-weight, he was almost as
quick as he had been at twenty-two.  He had a
sense of fair play which was almost disgusting to
masters of merchantmen, and a sense of humour
which sometimes got him into trouble with the
Foreign Office.  For it may have been noticed
that among the English Civil Service the only
humour, which is, one has to own, rather sardonic,
is to be found in that part of it which deals
with the Income Tax.  The very moment the
consul had the shamefaced crew before him,
and saw the officers, he knew where the trouble
lay, and he thought of the boxing gloves with
which he often whiled away an idle hour when
the vice-consul felt "good."
</p>

<p>
"Well, now, well, what's the trouble?"
asked the consul.
</p>

<p>
And Noyes told him where he thought it
lay.  Noyes was as smooth as bad butter, and
had a heartiness about him which would have
made a child cry for its mother.  All the time
he was talking, and the men were muttering
that he was a liar, the consul was taking the
crowd in.  He spotted many marks and bruises
on them, all come by honestly among themselves
or given them without malice by the gensd'armes;
but when his eye lighted on the man from Abo
it stayed there.
</p>

<p>
"A comfortable ship, yes, yes," said the
consul, "of course, of course!  And a tough
crowd to be sure.  Here you, come here!"
</p>

<p>
And as the others saw that he meant Hans,
they shoved him forward.
</p>

<p>
"That's a nice face you've got," said
Mr. Johnson.  "God bless my soul you've been
running against something.  Now I should
say&mdash;I should say&mdash;yes, by Jove, you've been
running against a telescope?"
</p>

<p>
And Hans nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Who gave you that?"
</p>

<p>
Noyes looked as black as his coat, but the
Finn pointed at him with his finger.
</p>

<p>
"The cap'en, sir."
</p>

<p>
The consul looked at them both.  He noted
that they were both of a size, both probably of
the same weight, and both looked as hard as
nickel steel.  His eye sparkled with a certain joy.
</p>

<p>
"Did you, Mr. Noyes?"
</p>

<p>
It enraged Noyes to be given his proper handle.
</p>

<p>
"And he deserved it," he said angrily.
</p>

<p>
"If you wanted to hit him you should have
done it with your hand.  But perhaps he would
have been too much for you without a weapon,"
suggested the consul suavely.
</p>

<p>
"Not he," retorted Noyes incautiously.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Johnson looked at them both, and
shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"I believe he would lick you in a fair fight,"
he said with a slight sniff, and Noyes exploded.
</p>

<p>
"I could pound him to almighty smash in
two minutes," he roared.
</p>

<p>
And the crowd began to see fun "sticking
out a foot."  They edged up closer and lost
their shamefaced look.
</p>

<p>
"He could knock hell out of you," said one
of them from behind, and the consul said:
</p>

<p>
"Hush, hush!"
</p>

<p>
Then he turned to Hans.
</p>

<p>
"Could he lick you, my man?"
</p>

<p>
"Not mooch," said Hans defiantly, and
a subdued cheer rose from the men behind.
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear that, Mr. Noyes?" asked
the consul.  "Oh yes, you hear it.  Well, it's
all highly irregular, of course, but you
understand you did wrong to hit him with a telescope,
or with anything for the matter of that, and as
the ship seems to have been anything but a
comfortable one, I suggest that you apologise
to this man at any rate, and pay him off."
</p>

<p>
"Ya, ya," said Hans, who at any rate
understood the last three words.
</p>

<p>
"I apologise?" gasped Noyes.  "By God,
I'll lick him first and do that after!
Apologise!"
</p>

<p>
"Either that, or I shall back him up in
proceeding against you.  Unless you would
like to settle it with him now in my courtyard,
with a couple of pairs of boxing gloves," said
Mr. Johnson persuasively, and the crowd
behind hummed applause.
</p>

<p>
"Lick him," said Bragg, "and lick him good."
</p>

<p>
He was not anxious for the job himself, but
was as eager to see the scrap as the consul.  It
is so seldom that an officer gets a chance of
seeing a real fight, and besides, he did not love
Noyes at all.
</p>

<p>
And inside of two minutes the inner court
saw the skipper of the <i>State of Oregon</i> and the
man from Abo stripped to their waists and
singlets.
</p>

<p>
"Pick your own seconds," said the consul
gleefully, "and I'll be referee and timekeeper."
</p>

<p>
He forgot there was such a thing as the
Foreign Office; but he did not forget some of
the habits and customs of Western America.
</p>

<p>
"There's to be no biting, or gouging or
kicking," he said, "and when a man goes down
he'll have ten seconds to get up in."
</p>

<p>
The next moment Noyes sailed in.  He was
not a bad fighter; he could hit hard at any
rate, and sometimes stopped a blow.  His
previous acquaintance with Hans's head led
him to go for his body, and that was perhaps
a little in his favour, for the Finn was all
abroad all the time.  At first Hans hit so
slowly that when he first got there Noyes was
gone, but he gradually got a little quicker.
When I was eleven stone weight I used
sometimes to box with a man who weighed
seventeen.  In the first round I used to hit
him when and where I pleased; in the second
I had to look out; in the third he used to get
there once and finish me for the day.  Like
Hans, he grew quicker as he grew warmer,
and yet Hans never touched the skipper at
all in the first round.  He was knocked all
over the place, and to any outsider it looked a
thousand to one on Authority.  But the odd
thing was that Hans's ribs seemed as hard as
his head, and his wind was invulnerable.  Twice
he went down, but he rose quick enough, and
when time was called no one puffed but the
skipper.
</p>

<p>
In the second round they clinched, and when
the consul called on them to break away Hans
fairly threw Noyes from him.
</p>

<p>
"He'll lick him yet," said Johnson, and
now Noyes had to defend himself.  Any one
of Hans's blows would have killed a cow if
it had fairly landed.  The skipper, half in
despair, hit at his opponent's head, and got
there.  He stopped Hans, but was jarred to the
shoulder.  When he recovered he landed, and
Hans went down to rise again like a fives ball
on a hard court, and though Noyes jabbed him
again and again straight in the face, he never
left any mark or blood behind him.  And
every blow of the Finn's came nearer, quicker,
more fiercely.  Time was called in time to save
the captain.
</p>

<p>
"I believe he'll do me," said Noyes.
</p>

<p>
"I believe it, too," said Bragg.  It was not
an encouraging remark to get from one's
second, and Noyes felt hurt.  While he was
sitting on Bragg's knee Hans was walking
round feeling his arms and talking.
</p>

<p>
"Ya, ya, I lick him goot," he said.  "I lick
him goot."
</p>

<p>
And now he was warm and like a flail.
Both arms were equally good; he went at his
man round arm, and missed him ten times by
a mere shave.  In the middle of the round
Noyes, who knew he was going, worked his
glove off in a close rally, and before the consul
could intervene he struck Hans full in the face
with his bare fist.  It was a timed blow
that ought to have stopped a rhinoceros,
and Hans threw his head up, as the consul
jumped in.
</p>

<p>
"Nein, nein," cried Hans, "take de oder
off.  I fight him so.  I fight goot now."
</p>

<p>
And so he did, for though the glove was put
on again, there was no sign of his having been
hit, and Noyes's right hand was useless.  A
left-hander finished it, and Noyes went off his
feet.  When he came to he was tired and
weary and found himself in the hospital with a
bandaged jaw.
</p>

<p>
"I tell <i>you</i> there's always suthin' queer about
a Finn," said the crowd.  "It took brass to
draw blood from him, now didn't it?"
</p>

<p>
And the man from Abo was paid off.
</p>

<p>
"I fights goot that day," he said, when he
got his money, and the consul, who is now a
magistrate at home, says there wasn't a bruise
on him.

<h3>
THE SCUTTLING OF THE <i>PANDORA</i>.
</h3>

<p>
There are ships with good and evil
reputations, independent of the men who
own or sail them.  Some, it would seem, had
their keels laid on a lucky day, others were
assuredly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  Built i' th' eclipse and rigged with curses dark.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Many have furrowed all the seas of ocean
and have lost no lives, and have cost neither
owner nor underwriters money.  But some
there are (and those who follow the sea will
know them) which have never achieved a single
passage without being nearly cast away,
without killing or maiming men.  For such a ship
the very shoals themselves decrease in depth
through the unlucky set of some abnormal
tide: for them the 'trades' spring up far south
and die in premature calm ten degrees from
the Line.  They are well built and highly
classed, and yet spring leaks.  Derelicts lie in
wait for them: they are chased through every
sea by cyclones and tornadoes.  In them the
luck of lucky men is finally of no avail:
seamen fall from aloft in calms; the gear gives
without notice; stores rot in spite of care.
They break the heart of all who have to do
with them: in them blood is suddenly spilt:
in them strong men waste and die.
</p>

<p>
Such a ship was the <i>Pandora</i>, and, as she lay
off Sandridge, at anchor in Hobson's Bay, there
was not a sailorman in Australia who would
have shipped in her from choice.
</p>

<p>
"I've heerd the skipper of one ship I was
in talk about the nature of vessels," said Jack
Marchmont, as he sat with his mate on the
end of the pier, "and <i>he</i> allowed that ships was
like men, launched with nat'ral dispositions.
He talked a lot of scientific guff about deviation,
and what he said was as ships had this or
that deviation all according how their heads
was p'inted on the stocks.  If she p'inted
sou-west, she played quite a different game with
the compass to what she would have done if
she had laid nor'-east.  And I believe him.
The <i>Pandora</i> must have p'inted straight for
hell, Joe."
</p>

<p>
"She is a bad 'un, I own," said his mate,
"but it ain't a matter of ch'ice.  Ships is few,
and men is plenty, and it's a case of 'John, get
up and let Jack sit down' with you and me.
If she was a wuss ship than she is, and a wetter
(though this ain't a wetter), and if she killed
as many as the plague, I ain't goin' to work
Tom Cox's traverse ashore any more.  And
there ain't no <i>beer</i> in the scuttle-butt neither,
and Bailey looks at us as black as black.  I'm
goin' to ship," and Joe Rennet rose.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't got a farden to jingle of a tombstone,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Mark me," said Jack gloomily, "you'll
never have no tombstone if we ships in the
<i>Pandora</i>.  'Tain't her way to run any man's
relatives into <i>that</i> expense."
</p>

<p>
But Joe shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Mebbe this trip'll break her luck; and
you've got to ship along.  'Cause why?  We've
on'y one chest atween the two of us.  Cheer
up, old son.  Why, I'd ship in the <i>Leander</i>,
and they say she killed and drownded seventy
men in five years.  Blow me, I've got to the
p'int that I'd ship in a blooming diving-bell!"
</p>

<p>
And three days later the two men, with
twelve others who were just as deep in debt to
the boarding-house keepers, signed on for the
<i>Pandora</i>, bound for London.  They went on
board that very night.  The mates kept a keen
eye on them: they knew the ship's reputation
and more than once men who had come on
board at night had disappeared by the morning.
The first few hours in any ship, as in any
other kind of work, are the most trying, and
the first sight of a damp and empty foc'sle is
for ever discouraging.  For all the <i>Pandora's</i>
crowd from London had "skipped" in
Melbourne.
</p>

<p>
"And right they was," said more than one
of the new crowd, "for one of them was killed,
and two was drowned, and another will walk
lame for the rest of his life."
</p>

<p>
But when the sun came up over the low
brown hills to the eastward, and the daylight
danced upon the landlocked waters of the great
bay, they turned to with more cheerful
hearts.  The summer had spent two of its
golden months, but the sky was clear, and a
warm north wind blew.  The ship was clean,
and yet not too clean.  It did not suggest the
interminable intolerable labour of an American
ship, all brass and bright-work.  And as the
new crew hove up the anchor they found the
windlass was no heart-breaker.
</p>

<p>
"Give it her, boys," said the mate, and they
slapped the brakes up and down with a will.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon the crowd aft are pretty decent,"
said Joe, as he jumped up aloft to loosen the
fore-topsail.  "Oh, I dessay she ain't 'arf bad."
</p>

<p>
And as the crew allowed, there was little to
complain of about the way the <i>Pandora</i> was
found.
</p>

<p>
"She ain't like our last ship," was Joe's
comment.  "Every time she 'it a sea out o'
the common she'd shake shearpoles off of 'er,
as a dog shakes water."
</p>

<p>
But Jack Marchmont was not consoled.
</p>

<p>
"I ain't denyin' that the owners and the
old man do their best," he said, "but if they
rove silk gear and bent silk sails, they'd not alter
the nature of her.  I'll feel safe when I grinds
gravel under my heels, and not till then."
</p>

<p>
They told each other dolorous tales of the
ship when they ate, and in the second dog-watch,
which was all their own.  And yet the wind
was fair and put them through Bass's Strait,
and well to the south and east, day by day.
</p>

<p>
"It's too good to last," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Aft much the same feeling existed, though
no one knew it for'ard.  Yet Captain Rayner
was a melancholy man, and seemed very soft to
those whom luck had ever sent to sea with
American ship-masters.  He had sailed three
voyages in the <i>Pandora</i> and had read the burial
service every passage.  Once he had read it to
the devouring sea as a grave, when five men
had gone at once from the foc'sle head; but
he never spoke of the ship and her ways, even
if he always came on deck with the air of a
man who expects bad news.  Though he never
knew it, his look at last got upon the men's
nerves.  But their nerve was shaken from the
first; superstition had hold of them.  They
called him 'Jonah.'
</p>

<p>
"It's a black look out with such a skipper,"
said some, and though the evil history of the
<i>Pandora</i> ran far back beyond Rayner's time,
they attributed her present ill-luck to him.
</p>

<p>
The mind of the seaman is a limited mind.
He is a child, a creature of arrested development.
The infinite sameness of the sea, its
dull and at times appalling lack of interest, do
not move him to growth.  The romance of it
is for those who know it not, or for those who
pass beyond the borders of its great roads of
travel.  For the merchant seaman the ocean
is a method of toil; only disaster or the fear
of it gives it savour.  And the work is the
same for ever.  They dwell on little things,
are easily pleased, easily hurt.  In such minds
grows superstition, in such panic fears flourish
if they are not held in a strong hand.  Though
both the mates were good men, they were young,
and Rayner was weak.
</p>

<p>
The very fairness of the weather, though fair
weather is common enough off the Horn in
summer, got on the crew's minds, when they
came in sight of the Diego Ramirez Islands
and presently hauled up for the north.
</p>

<p>
"None of us ever passed these 'ere Daggarammarines
in weather like this," they said, as
they shook their heads.  "Why, it might be
a mill-pond!"
</p>

<p>
And when, three days later, a change of
weather sent a south-west gale howling after
them, they shook their heads again.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, she's goin' to get it now.  This'll
make up for it.  Who's goin' first?"
</p>

<p>
They found out now what the <i>Pandora</i> could
do to make their lives unhappy.  She was both
weatherly and fast, but her lines for'ard were
such that she never rose to any sea she struck
till green water poured over the top-gallant
foc'sle two feet deep.  She shipped one sea
at midnight that ripped off the scuttle-hatch
and poured solid water into the foc'sle that
washed the men out of the lower bunks.  The
hatch went overboard, and it was morning before
any one dared go on the foc'sle head to spike
planks down in place of it.  All night long a
cataract poured down on them, and water
spurted in through the plugged hawse pipes.
Soon there was not a dry blanket in their den;
steam rose from the wet-packed sleepers.  It
was 'all hands' at four bells in the middle
watch, and they went on deck to shorten sail.
Not a man wore oilskins; they had nothing to
keep from getting wet.  Even Joe, who was
the most cheerful man for'ard, fell to
growling.
</p>

<p>
"Call this a ship?" he said.  "She's scared
of the top of the sea and wants to dive so's to
get out o' the wet.  Stow the foresail, is it?
I reckon the old man is goin' to heave her to
while he can.  He can't have much heart to do
it with a fair wind."
</p>

<p>
And perhaps Rayner had little heart.  But
if he had little, the mate was cheery enough.
He bellowed loudly, and the men jumped.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, haul taut the lifts," he roared.
"That'll do.  Weather clew-garner!  Ease off
the sheet a bit!"
</p>

<p>
They slacked away the tack and hauled up
the weather-gear.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, lee-gear, and jump aloft and
furl it."
</p>

<p>
The night was black and the wind heavy in
increasing squalls.  Even with the foresail
hanging in the gear, and bellying out in great
white bladders, she still cut the seas like a
knife, and scooped the seas in over her head.
Blankets and bags washed out on deck, for
there was no door to the men's quarters, only
a heavy canvas screen from the break of the
foc'sle.  And from aloft dull foam gleamed
as the <i>Pandora</i> drove the seas asunder.  The
men sprang into the weather-rigging with the
second mate leading.  As he came to the
futtock shrouds, he laid hold of the foremost
shroud with his right hand, and jumped
for the band of the yard-truss.  His foot
slipped and his hand-hold gave.  He snatched
with a yell at the top-gallant sheet leading
through the top, but was too late to grasp and
hold it.
</p>

<p>
"By God, the <i>Pandora's</i> luck," said the men
in the rigging as they heard him reach the
deck.  And when the foresail was stowed
and they went down they heard the man
was dead.  They found the <i>Pandora</i> made
heavy weather still, when she was brought to
the wind, and she only lay to decently when
she was stripped to the goose-winged
main-topsail.  The men went into their wet and
devastated den in gloomy silence.
</p>

<p>
"'Ere's a bloomin' pretty general average,"
said Joe, as he found his chest, which was also
his chum's, staved in by the impact of an
iron-bound one which had fetched away from
its lashings.  But no one growled, and no one
answered him.  The young second "greaser"
had been liked by them.  They sat and
smoked in gloomy silence, and only half of
the watch below turned into the driest bunks.
They thought that the <i>Pandora</i> had begun,
and though she lay to easily enough, few slept.
They were afraid of their ship; she was
unlucky, accursed, an evil personality.  About her
was the odour of death.
</p>

<p>
"Case was a good boy," they said, "and
would have been a fine officer by-and-by.
Well, our turn next."
</p>

<p>
Every time the <i>Pandora</i> bowed a wave the
hawse-holes still spurted; the foc'sle deck ran
wet and glimmered darkly in the feeble light
from the stinking lanterns swinging on both
port and starboard sides.  The air was saturated
with moisture, rank sweat ran down the beams,
dripping blankets swayed from the edges of
unoccupied bunks; the men were damp,
subdued, unhappy.  Now, as the ship lay to,
the wind no longer swept into the foc'sle
under the flapping screen by the windlass,
but still eddies of swift cold air shook it, and
the men shivered under their oilskins, that
they wore now for warmth.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I'd never seed her," said Jack
Marchmont, and Joe did not answer his mate.
Not ten words were spoken till the wheel and
look-out were relieved at four o'clock.  Both
were idle jobs, for the night was still as
dark as death, and the wheel with a grummet
over its spokes looked after itself.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's all solid comfort, this is," said
Jack.  "I wonder whose wet clothes will be
for sale next?"
</p>

<p>
They buried the second mate in the grey
waste of sea before they put the <i>Pandora</i> before
the moderating gale.  The mate read the
burial service, for Captain Rayner stayed below.
The steward told the men in a whisper that
he was ill.
</p>

<p>
"He's all broke up," he said, "I seed him
cryin' like a child.  And no wonder; this is
a wicked ship.  I wish I'd left her in
Melbourne."
</p>

<p>
And some of the men frowned.  They did
not like to hear him call the <i>Pandora</i> wicked.
For the ship was, in its way, alive; it was
possessed.  They wished to propitiate it;
superstition had them by the throat.
</p>

<p>
But they were easier when the body was
committed to the deep.  And the mate assumed a
more cheerful air when he had carried the Prayer
Book into his berth and came on deck again.
They put the ship before the wind and loosed
the foresail.  But though the wind had taken
off, the sea was very heavy, and the <i>Pandora</i>
wallowed riotously.  She took in seas over
both rails.  Thrice that day she filled the
main-deck, and but for the life-lines rigged right
from the foc'sle to the poop many men would
have been washed overboard.  As she ran
with the wind on the port quarter, she
sometimes dived as if she would never come up.
The galley fire was out, and could not be lighted;
the men drank water and ate biscuit.
</p>

<p>
"Hogs, dogs, and sailors," they said.  Every
time the vessel dived they held their breath.
</p>

<p>
The mate had a hard time, for Rayner was
incapable of work, and she carried no
apprentices.  Forward there was no one capable
of an officer's work; there was no broken
skipper whom drink had destroyed, no young
fellow with a second mate's "ticket."  So
Mr. Gamgee practically slept on deck in
snatches till he slept almost as he stood under
the weather-cloth in the mizzen rigging.  He
prayed for moderate weather, for a sight of
the sun.  But though the gale was less, it
still blew hard, and the sky was black and
the racing scud low, and the sun was not
seen by day or a star by night.  On the third
day Gamgee staggered as he walked.
</p>

<p>
"If the old man can't come on deck soon
I'll have to cave in," he thought.  He shook
his fist at the ship.  "I wish I'd never seen
her.  She's a man-killer."
</p>

<p>
That night when the starboard watch was
called at twelve the wind took off suddenly,
and the <i>Pandora</i> pounded in the wallow of
the sea like a bull-buffalo in a bog.  She
shipped seas over both rails; the racing waves
astern came and slapped their crests at the
man at the wheel; she scooped up the sea
forward every stagger she made.  She had
been running under the reefed foresail and
the fore and main topsails close reefed.  Now
they shook the reefs out.  Gamgee was alert
and alive, but his nerves half-betrayed him.  He
jumped from the poop to the main-deck, and
back again.  He wanted to be mate and second
mate and skipper too.  And as the fresh
canvas took hold of her, she slapped at the
rising sea, dived into it, and as the wind
bellowed almost as keen as ever, the man at
the wheel lost his nerve, gave her too much
helm, snatched at her, gave her too much again,
and almost broached her to.  And then the
mate was again on the main-deck.
</p>

<p>
Some one heard him say "O God!" as the
Atlantic fell on board; but no one ever heard
him say anything again.
</p>

<p>
The water filled her from rail to rail.  She
shuddered, and then lifted slowly, and as she
ran once more before the wind and rolled,
she poured out the sea on either side.  The
main-deck ports were burst outward, the gear
floated in inextricable tangles, a four-hundred-gallon
tank, lashed under the poop ladders,
broke from its lashings and took charge of the
deck.  In the black darkness and the imminent
danger men cried out.  Some cried to their mates
and were answered, some were not answered.
With the mate three other men had gone.
</p>

<p>
And then she cleared herself once more, and
the men came together under the break of the
poop.  Joe asked for Jack Marchmont; but
Jack had saved any one from the expense of
a tombstone.
</p>

<p>
"And I over-persuaded 'im to ship in her.
Oh, she's a bloody ship."
</p>

<p>
Then one man said:
</p>

<p>
"Where's Mr. Gamgee?"
</p>

<p>
Joe ran up to the poop.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Gamgee! sir!"
</p>

<p>
"He ain't here," said the man at the wheel.
"Oh, Joe, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"'Twas your doin'," cried Joe.  "There's two
gone, and Jack with 'em, and Mr. Gamgee!"
</p>

<p>
And the man at the wheel fell all ashake.
His face was ashy in the feeble glimmer of the
binnacle light.
</p>

<p>
"Come and take her, Joe," he implored.
"Oh, the swine she is.  I'm in a tremble,
Joe.  She's too much for me."
</p>

<p>
And tragedy heaped itself on tragedy.  The
steward came on deck, and heard that the mate
was gone.  He lost his head and ran in to the
captain crying; he was ludicrous, horrible,
speechless.  And Rayner sat up in his bunk,
and fell back without knowing what had
happened.  He never knew, for though the
steward shook him feebly, his failing heart had
failed, and brandy never brought him to.  The
steward ran on deck blubbering.
</p>

<p>
"I believe the captain's dead," he sobbed.
</p>

<p>
And the two boldest of the men took off
their caps and went into the cabin humbly.
A greater than their commander was there.
They stood in silence, fiddling with their caps,
and stared at the quiet white face upon its
pillow.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, he's dead," they whispered.  They
backed out respectfully; they were stunned,
and were adrift; they were all masterless men;
authority had been removed; they faced the
unknown with dread.  They saw now that they
had rested on others' knowledge.  What did
they know of the sea after all?
</p>

<p>
They gathered on the poop.
</p>

<p>
"What?" said Joe, who was at the wheel.
"Him gone too.  And we&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
They all understood.  They were in peculiar
isolation, in danger.  And what would be
said if they saved themselves and the ship?
</p>

<p>
"'Twill look as if we'd mutinied," said
Joe.  But he had a touch of natural authority
in him.  "As soon as it gets light we'll write
out a true account of it and sign it, all of us.
And we'll make for the nearest port."
</p>

<p>
They were all quiet men, Englishmen and
Dutchmen, and there was no more drink in
the ship than that in the medicine chest.  The
steward drank what remained of it.  And in
the morning all the remainder of the crew met
on the poop.  At first they had a certain
natural reluctance to use that portion of the
ship, but if they did not meet there the steersman
could not take his share in the talk.  But
Joe did most of the talking.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon the nearest port is Buenos Ayres,"
he said.  "This mornin' I took the liberty of
lookin' at the chart, and there ain't nothin'
'andier as is common talk with sailormen.  If
we stand north we'll about 'it it off; or any
ways, we'll 'it on the track of steamers makin'
for it, and we might get the lend of a hofficer
to take us in.  What do you say, mates?"
</p>

<p>
Some nodded, some shrugged their shoulders,
and some said, "Buenos Ayres?  Oh yes, that'll
do as well as another."
</p>

<p>
"And I've took the liberty," said Joe
solemnly, "of borrowin' the log-book from
down below, and I've wrote out a plain account
of all this 'ere, as I said last night.  For it's
best put down, and it's ships' law as everythin'
serious should be wrote out in the log-book,
and nowheres else.  Shall I read it?"
</p>

<p>
And he read out what he had written:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"Three days back, as told in the log, Mr. Case,
the second mate, fell from the foreyard as we was
goin' to take in the foresail, and was killed.  He was
buried accordin' the next day, while we was 'ove to.
And last night in the middle watch, as all 'ands
was makin' sail, the wind 'avin' fallen light sudden
and the sea bein' very 'eavy, we shipped an 'eavy
sea over the port rail as washed Mr. Gamjy
overboard with Jack Marchmont, A.B., Andrew
Anderson, A.B., and Thomas Griggs, boy.  And
the captain bein' ill, as the log says, died sudden
on 'earing it, and is now lyin' dead in 'is cabin.
Whereas, there bein' no officer in the ship, all 'ands
assembled as aforesaid, declares this is the truth,
the 'ole truth, and nothin' but the truth, so 'elp us
Gawd.  And we intends makin' for bonus airs,
or monty Vidyo."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And one by one the crew signed this simple
statement, as it was held down on the top of
the signal locker by its author.  Those who
could not write&mdash;and there were three who
could not&mdash;made their marks when Joe signed
for them.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever 'appens to this blasted 'ooker,
we must keep 'old of this log," said Joe.  "For
supposin' any hother disaster befell us, as seems
likely enough, and we took to the boats, it
would look very bad for us, without a single
officer."
</p>

<p>
It was a cold and unhappy day for them as
they drove to the north-east, still under short
canvas.  But the weather broke a little, and
they set the topgallant-sails at last.
</p>

<p>
"So long as we don't pile her up on the
Falklands we should do," said the one other
man on board beside Joe who seemed capable
of taking responsibility.  He was from
Newcastle, and was, of course, known as Geordie.
Naturally enough he and Joe divided the
watches between them, and the remainder of
the crowd sheltered their uneasy minds under
their strength.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose if we bring her in we might get
something extra," said Geordie, the day they
buried the captain.
</p>

<p>
But Joe took him by the arm and led him
for'ard from the wheel, at which a patient Swede
stood.
</p>

<p>
"Geordie, old man, do you want to bring
her in?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes, I suppose so," said Geordie.
He stared at Joe.  "What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
Joe broke out strangely and struck his fist
upon the rail.
</p>

<p>
"I want to see 'er sink," he said savagely.
"I want to see 'er go where she's put so many
good men.  What right 'as we to save 'er to
do more 'arm?  It ain't alone as she's drownded
my chum or the others, but she 'as a black
record that ain't finished unless we finish it.
She's strong, and will go on killin' for twenty
years, Geordie.  She'll make money for them
as doesn't care, but what of the likes of us?"
</p>

<p>
He was greatly moved.
</p>

<p>
"She's caulked with men's lives, and painted
with their blood!" he cried passionately.  "I'd
rather she sunk with me than sailed the seas
any more."
</p>

<p>
And Geordie fidgeted uneasily
</p>

<p>
"That's true, mate, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Aye," said Joe, "I know.  If we scuttled
'er 'twould look bad, and it's bad enough as
it is; but 'tis a good deed, if we done it,
and it should be done, and I'll tell you 'ow
to do it."
</p>

<p>
He leant upon the rail and spoke earnestly,
in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"It won't do, I own, to scuttle 'er at sea, not
even if we let on she leaked and logged it day
by day.  But if we sunk 'er in the Plate or in
the bay at Monte Video, 'twould do right enough,
and I've a plan for that.  I made it out in the
morning watch.  'Tis as easy as eatin', and easier
a deal than eatin' ship's biscuit.  Down below
in the lazareet I'll bore 'oles in her, three or
four, and plug 'em on the inside, about a foot
below the water-line.  And I'll over the side
and plug 'em outside, then I'll draw the inside
plugs.  D'ye see?"
</p>

<p>
And Geordie saw.
</p>

<p>
"You needn't know it.  I can do it my
lone," said Joe.  "And do it I will.  If we
gets off 'er safe she shan't kill no more.  When
we're out of her&mdash;and none of us will stay, as
you know&mdash;she'll lie at anchor waitin' for a
new crowd, and I'll come out to her in a
boat and sink the murderin' old 'ooker right
there."
</p>

<p>
"There'll be a ship-keeper on her," said
Geordie.
</p>

<p>
"As like as not 'e'll on'y be a Spaniard,"
replied Joe simply.  "And even if not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Even if not, one more was but one.
</p>

<p>
The next day the weather moderated, and
the <i>Pandora</i>, being then, as they reckoned, well
clear of the Falklands, stood due north for Cape
Corrientes with the wind almost on the port
beam.  That night Joe went down into the
lazaret with an auger, and bored three holes
in her weather side.
</p>

<p>
"Good stuff and sound," he said, as he
sweated over his task.  "She might 'ave floated
for hever."
</p>

<p>
When he drew out his auger he found that
the sea raced past the hole and sometimes flipped
water into it.
</p>

<p>
"On a level keel she'll have 'em about two
foot under," he said.  He plugged that hole
and bored two others.  When he had plugged
these, he went on deck again.  There was not
a soul awake on her but Geordie and the man
at the wheel.  She was going now very sweetly,
and making ten knots: they were running into
fair weather.  But she lay over far enough to
make it easy for Joe to go over the side, while
Geordie slacked him down from a pin in the rail.
</p>

<p>
"It's done," said Joe, as he came on board.
"She'll kill no more."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him that he was doing a good
deed, for the <i>Pandora</i> was cruel.
</p>

<p>
And a week later, though they had sighted
no land, the colour of the water had changed
curiously, and looked a little reddish.  When
they drew some on board it was evidently not
so salt as the sea, and they knew they were in
the flood of the mighty Plate.  The airs were
now light and westerly; they hauled their
wind and stood for the north-west.  But still
the man on the look-out on the main-royal-yard
saw no land.  In the afternoon they sighted
the smoke of a steamer heading about west by
south on their starboard beam.  They laid their
main-topsail to the mast and hoisted the Jack,
union down.
</p>

<p>
That night they were at anchor off Monte
Video, and in the morning they told their story
to the British Consul.  But one and all refused
at any price and at all costs to go on board
of the <i>Pandora</i> again.  Joe spoke for all of them.
</p>

<p>
"We'll go to gaol sooner, sir," he said, as
he stepped in front of his mates, twiddling his
cap nervously, "though we wishes to say so
respectfully, sir.  She's a man-killer, and it's
better a sight to be in the jug, or on the beach,
than to be drownded.  She's killed my own
mate, and more than 'im.  And so far back as
hany of us ever 'eard of 'er, she's been at the
same job.  If you please, sir, we'd rather go to
gaol."
</p>

<p>
They slept that night ashore, but not in gaol,
and next day the owners cabled from England
for a new crew to be shipped in her at any
price.  But no price could induce men to go
in her.  And on the third night she sank at
her moorings in fifteen fathoms of water, and
carried her ship-keeper to the bottom.
</p>

<p>
"I told you she'd kill another man yet," said
Geordie.
</p>

<p>
But Joe shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I done what was right.  And after all, 'e
was on'y a Spaniard, as I said."

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
